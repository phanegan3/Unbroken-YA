<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:216.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The men had been adrift for twenty-seven days. Borne by an equatorial current, they had floated at</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:234.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">least one thousand miles, deep into Japanese-controlled waters. The rafts were beginning to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:251.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">deteriorate into jelly, and gave off a sour, burning odor. The men’s bodies were pocked with salt</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:268.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">sores, and their lips were so swollen that they pressed into their nostrils and chins. They spent their</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:285.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">days with their eyes fixed on the sky, singing “White Christmas,” muttering about food. No one was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:303.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">even looking for them anymore. They were alone on sixty-four million square miles of ocean.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:320.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">A month earlier, twenty-six-year-old Zamperini had been one of the greatest runners in the world,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:337.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">expected by many to be the first to break the four-minute mile, one of the most celebrated barriers in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:354.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">sport. Now his Olympian’s body had wasted to less than one hundred pounds and his famous legs</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:372.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">could no longer lift him. Almost everyone outside of his family had given him up for dead.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:389.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">On that morning of the twenty-seventh day, the men heard a distant, deep strumming. Every airman</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:406.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">knew that sound: pistons. Their eyes caught a glint in the sky—a plane, high overhead. Zamperini</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:423.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">fired two flares and shook powdered dye into the water, enveloping the rafts in a circle of vivid</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:441.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">orange. The plane kept going, slowly disappearing. The men sagged. Then the sound returned, and the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:458.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">plane came back into view. The crew had seen them.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:475.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">With arms shrunken to little more than bone and yellowed skin, the castaways waved and shouted,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:492.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">their voices thin from thirst. The plane dropped low and swept alongside the rafts. Zamperini saw the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:510.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">profiles of the crewmen, dark against bright blueness.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:527.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">There was a terrific roaring sound. The water, and the rafts themselves, seemed to boil. It was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:544.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">machine gun fire. This was not an American rescue plane. It was a Japanese bomber.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:561.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The men pitched themselves into the water and hung together under the rafts, cringing as bullets</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:596.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">blazed on, then sputtered out as the bomber overshot them. The men dragged themselves back onto the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:613.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">one raft that was still mostly inflated. The bomber banked sideways, circling toward them again. As it</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:630.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">leveled off, Zamperini could see the muzzles of the machine guns, aimed directly at them.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:648.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Zamperini looked toward his crewmates. They were too weak to go back in the water. As they lay</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:665.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">down on the floor of the raft, hands over their heads, Zamperini splashed overboard alone.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:682.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Somewhere beneath him, the sharks were done waiting. They bent their bodies in the water and</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:204.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">a coal miner and boxer, then as a construction worker. His mother, Louise, was a petite, playful</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:222.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">beauty, sixteen at marriage and eighteen when Louie was born. In their apartment, where only Italian</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:239.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was spoken, Louise and Anthony called their boy Toots.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:256.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">From the moment he could walk, Louie couldn’t bear to be corralled. His siblings would recall</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:273.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">him careening about, hurdling flora, fauna, and furniture. The instant Louise thumped him into a chair</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and told him to be still, he vanished. If she didn’t have her squirming boy clutched in her hands, she</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:308.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">usually had no idea where he was.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:325.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In 1919, when two-year-old Louie was down with pneumonia, he climbed out his bedroom</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:360.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">him and a crowd watching in amazement. Soon after, on a pediatrician’s advice, Louise and Anthony</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:377.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">decided to move their children to the warmer climes of California. Sometime after their train pulled</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:394.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">out of Grand Central Station, Louie bolted, ran the length of the train, and leapt from the caboose.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:411.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Standing with his frantic mother as the train rolled backward in search of the lost boy, Louie’s older</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:429.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">brother, Pete, spotted Louie strolling up the track in perfect serenity. Swept up in his mother’s arms,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:446.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie smiled. “I knew you’d come back,” he said in Italian.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:463.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In California, Anthony landed a job as a railway electrician and bought a half-acre field on the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:480.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">edge of Torrance, population 1,800. He and Louise hammered up a one-room shack with no running</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:498.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">water, an outhouse behind, and a roof that leaked so badly that they had to keep buckets on the beds.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:515.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">With only hook latches for locks, Louise took to sitting by the front door on an apple box with a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:532.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">rolling pin in her hand, ready to brain any prowlers who might threaten her children.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:549.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">There, and at the Gramercy Avenue house where they settled a year later, Louise kept prowlers out,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:567.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">but couldn’t keep Louie in hand. Contesting a footrace across a busy highway, he just missed getting</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:584.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">broadsided by a jalopy. At five, he started smoking, picking up discarded cigarette butts while</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:601.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">walking to kindergarten. He began drinking one night when he was eight; he hid under the dinner</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:618.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">table, snatched glasses of wine, drank them all dry, staggered outside, and fell into a rosebush.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:636.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">On one day, Louise discovered that Louie had impaled his leg on a bamboo beam; on another, she</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:653.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">had to ask a neighbor to sew Louie’s severed toe back on. When Louie came home drenched in oil</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:670.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">after scaling an oil rig, diving into a sump well, and nearly drowning, it took a gallon of turpentine</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:687.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and a lot of scrubbing before Anthony recognized his son again.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Thrilled by the crashing of boundaries, Louie was untamable. As he grew into his uncommonly</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:34.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">If it was edible, Louie stole it. He skulked down alleys, a roll of lock-picking wire in his pocket.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:120.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">icebox. At another party, he absconded with an entire keg of beer. When he discovered that the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:138.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">cooling tables at Meinzer’s Bakery stood within an arm’s length of the back door, he began picking</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:155.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the lock, snatching pies, eating until he was full, and reserving the rest as ammunition for ambushes.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:172.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">When rival thieves took up the racket, he suspended the stealing until the culprits were caught and the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:189.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">bakery owners dropped their guard. Then he ordered his friends to rob Meinzer’s again.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:207.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">It is a testament to the content of Louie’s childhood that his stories about it usually ended with “…</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:241.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">threatened to shoot him. To minimize the evidence found on him when the police habitually came his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:258.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">way, he set up loot-stashing sites around town, including a three-seater cave that he dug in a nearby</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:276.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">forest. Under the Torrance High bleachers, Pete once found a stolen wine jug that Louie had hidden</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:293.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">there. It was teeming with inebriated ants.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:310.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In the lobby of the Torrance theater, Louie stopped up the pay telephone’s coin slots with toilet</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:327.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">paper. He returned regularly to feed wire behind the coins stacked up inside, hook the paper, and fill</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:396.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">kids to pacify them, Louie declared a truce with the enemy and they cruised around staging brawls</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:431.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">To get even with a railcar conductor who wouldn’t stop for him, Louie greased the rails. When a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:448.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">teacher made him stand in a corner for spitballing, he deflated her car tires with toothpicks. After</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:465.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">setting a legitimate Boy Scout state record in friction-fire ignition, he broke his record by soaking his</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:517.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">spat them through the tube, and sent the neighborhood girls running.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:534.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">His magnum opus became legend. Late one night, Louie climbed the steeple of a Baptist church,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:552.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">rigged the bell with piano wire, strung the wire into a nearby tree, and roused the police, the fire</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:569.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">department, and all of Torrance with apparently spontaneous pealing. The more credulous townsfolk</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:586.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">called it a sign from God.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:603.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Only one thing scared him. When Louie was in late boyhood, a pilot landed a plane near Torrance</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:621.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and took Louie up for a flight. One might have expected such an intrepid child to be ecstatic, but the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:638.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">speed and altitude frightened him. From that day on, he wanted nothing to do with airplanes.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:655.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In a childhood of artful dodging, Louie made more than just mischief. He shaped who he would be</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:672.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">in manhood. Confident that he was clever, resourceful, and bold enough to escape any predicament,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:690.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">he was almost incapable of discouragement. When history carried him into war, this resilient</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:707.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">optimism would define him.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:2.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie was twenty months younger than his brother, who was everything he was not. Pete Zamperini</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:19.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was handsome, popular, impeccably groomed, polite to elders and avuncular to juniors, silky smooth</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:36.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">with girls, and blessed with such sound judgment that even when he was a child, his parents consulted</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:54.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">him on difficult decisions. He ushered his mother into her seat at dinner, turned in at seven, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:71.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">tucked his alarm clock under his pillow so as not to wake Louie, with whom he shared a bed. He rose</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:88.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">at two-thirty to run a three-hour paper route, and deposited all his earnings in the bank, which would</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">swallow every penny when the Depression hit. He had a lovely singing voice and a gallant habit of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:123.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">carrying pins in his pant cuffs, in case his dance partner’s dress strap failed. He once saved a girl</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:140.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">from drowning. Pete radiated a gentle but impressive authority that led everyone he met, even adults,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:157.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to be swayed by his opinion. Even Louie, who made a religion out of heeding no one, did as Pete</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:174.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">said.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:192.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie idolized Pete, who watched over him and their younger sisters, Sylvia and Virginia, with</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:209.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">paternal protectiveness. But Louie was eclipsed, and he never heard the end of it. Sylvia would recall</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:226.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">her mother tearfully telling Louie how she wished he could be more like Pete. What made it more</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:243.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">galling was that Pete’s reputation was part myth. Though Pete earned grades little better than Louie’s</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:261.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">failing ones, his principal assumed that he was a straight-A student. On the night of Torrance’s church</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:278.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">bell miracle, a well-directed flashlight would have revealed Pete’s legs dangling from the tree</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:295.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">alongside Louie’s. And Louie wasn’t always the only Zamperini boy who could be seen sprinting</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:312.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">down the alley with food that had lately belonged to the neighbors. But it never occurred to anyone to</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:347.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Nothing about Louie fit with other kids. He was a puny boy, and in his first years in Torrance, his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:364.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">lungs were still compromised enough from the pneumonia that in picnic footraces, every girl in town</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">could dust him. His features, which would later settle into pleasant collaboration, were growing at</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">different rates, giving him a curious face that seemed designed by committee. His ears leaned</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:416.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">sidelong off his head like holstered pistols, and above them waved a calamity of black hair that</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:433.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">mortified him. He attacked it with his aunt Margie’s hot iron, hobbled it in a silk stocking every night,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:450.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and slathered it with so much olive oil that flies trailed him to school. It did no good.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:468.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">And then there was his ethnicity. In Torrance in the early 1920s, Italians were held in such disdain</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:554.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">He was a marked boy. Bullies, drawn by his oddity and hoping to goad him into uttering Italian</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:347.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">blue eyes. When pushed, she shoved; sold a bad cut of meat, she’d march down to the butcher, frying</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:364.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">pan in hand. Loving mischief, she spread icing over a cardboard box and presented it as a birthday</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:588.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">meals in spiteful solitude off the open oven door. He once became so enraged with her that he chased</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:606.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">her around the block. Outrunning Louie for the only time in her life, Sylvia cut down the alley and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:623.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">dove into her father’s work shed. Louie flushed her out by feeding his three-foot-long pet snake into</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:640.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the crawl space. She then locked herself in the family car and didn’t come out for an entire afternoon.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:143.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">locksmith shop when he heard someone say that if you put any key in any lock, it has a one-in-fifty</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:160.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">chance of fitting. Inspired, Louie began collecting keys and trying locks. He had no luck until he tried</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:177.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">his house key on the back door of the Torrance High gym. When basketball season began, there was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:195.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">an inexplicable discrepancy between the number of ten-cent tickets sold and the considerably larger</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:212.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">number of kids in the bleachers. In late 1931, someone caught on, and Louie was hauled to the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:229.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">principal’s office for the umpteenth time. In California, winter-born students entered new grades in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:246.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">January, so Louie was about to start ninth grade. The principal punished him by making him ineligible</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:264.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">for athletic and social activities. Louie, who never joined anything, was indifferent.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:281.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">When Pete learned what had happened, he headed straight to the principal’s office. Though his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:298.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">mother didn’t yet speak much English, he towed her along to give his presentation weight. He told the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:315.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">principal that Louie craved attention but had never won it in the form of praise, so he sought it in the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:333.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">form of punishment. If Louie were recognized for doing something right, Pete argued, he’d turn his life</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:350.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">around. He asked the principal to allow Louie to join a sport. When the principal balked, Pete asked</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:367.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">him if he could live with allowing Louie to fail. It was a cheeky thing for a sixteen-year-old to say to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:384.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">his principal, but Pete was the one kid in Torrance who could get away with such a remark, and make</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:402.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">it persuasive. Louie was made eligible for athletics for 1932.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:419.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Pete had big plans for Louie. A senior in 1931-32, he would graduate with ten varsity letters,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:436.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">including three in basketball and three in baseball. But it was track, in which he earned four varsity</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:453.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">letters, tied the school half-mile record, and set its mile record of 5:06, that was his true forte.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:471.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Looking at Louie, whose getaway speed was his saving grace, Pete thought he saw the same incipient</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:488.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">talent.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:505.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">As it turned out, it wasn’t Pete who got Louie onto a track for the first time. It was Louie’s</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:522.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">weakness for girls. In February, the ninth-grade girls began assembling a team for an interclass track</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:540.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">meet, and in a class with only four boys, Louie was the only male who looked like he could run. The</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:557.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">girls worked their charms, and Louie found himself standing on the track, barefoot, for a 660-yard</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:574.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">race. When everyone ran, he followed, churning along with jimmying elbows and dropping far</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:591.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">behind. As he labored home last, he heard tittering. Gasping and humiliated, he ran straight off the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:609.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">track and hid under the bleachers. The coach muttered something about how that kid belonged</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:626.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">anywhere but in a footrace. “He’s my brother,” Pete replied.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:643.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">From that day on, Pete was all over Louie, forcing him to train, then dragging him to the track to run</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:660.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">in a second meet. Urged on by kids in the stands, Louie put in just enough effort to beat one boy and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:678.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">finish third. He hated running, but the applause was intoxicating, and the prospect of more was just</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:695.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">enough incentive to keep him marginally compliant. Pete herded him out to train every day and rode</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:712.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">his bicycle behind him, whacking him with a stick. Louie dragged his feet, bellyached, and quit at the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:729.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">first sign of fatigue. Pete made him get up and keep going. Louie started winning. At the season’s end,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:747.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">he became the first Torrance kid to make the All City Finals. He finished fifth.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:764.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Pete had been right about Louie’s talent. But to Louie, training felt like one more constraint. At</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:101.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">threw some clothes into a bag and stormed toward the front door. His parents ordered him to stay;</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:118.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie was beyond persuasion. As he walked out, his mother rushed to the kitchen and emerged with a</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:170.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">two dollars in his outstretched hand. It was a lot of money for a man whose paycheck didn’t bridge</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:273.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">squirmed out, and helped his friend out, badly cutting himself in the process. Then they were</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">discovered by the railroad detective, who forced them to jump from the moving train at gunpoint.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:342.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">sharing a stolen can of beans. A train rattled past. Louie looked up. “I saw … beautiful white</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:545.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In the summer of 1932, Louie did almost nothing but run. On the invitation of a friend, he went to stay</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:562.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">at a cabin on the Cahuilla Indian Reservation, in southern California’s high desert. Each morning, he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:579.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">rose with the sun, picked up his rifle, and jogged into the sagebrush. He ran up and down hills, over</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:597.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the desert, through gullies. He chased bands of horses, darting into the swirling herds and trying in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:614.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">vain to snatch a fistful of mane and swing aboard. He swam in a sulfur spring, watched over by</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:631.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Cahuilla women scrubbing clothes on the rocks, and stretched out to dry himself in the sun. On his run</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:648.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">back to the cabin each afternoon, he shot a rabbit for supper. Each evening, he climbed atop the cabin</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:666.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and lay back, reading Zane Grey novels. When the sun sank and the words faded, he gazed over the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:683.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">landscape, moved by its beauty, watching it slip from gray to purple before darkness blended land</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:700.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and sky. In the morning he rose to run again. He didn’t run from something or to something, not for</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:717.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">anyone or in spite of anyone; he ran because it was what his body wished to do. The restiveness, the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:735.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">self-consciousness, and the need to oppose disappeared. All he felt was peace.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:19.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">school, and to the beach and back. He rarely stayed on the sidewalk, veering onto neighbors’ lawns to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:36.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">hurdle bushes. He gave up drinking and smoking. To expand his lung capacity, he ran to the public</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:54.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">pool at Redondo Beach, dove to the bottom, grabbed the drain plug, and just floated there, hanging on</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:71.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">a little longer each time. Eventually, he could stay underwater for three minutes and forty-five</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:88.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">seconds. People kept jumping in to save him.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie also found a role model. In the 1930s, track was hugely popular, and its elite performers</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:123.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">were household names. Among them was a Kansas University miler named Glenn Cunningham. As a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:140.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">small child, Cunningham had been in a schoolhouse explosion that killed his brother and left Glenn</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:157.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">with severe burns on his legs and torso. It was a month and a half before he could sit up, and more</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:174.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">time still before he could stand. Unable to straighten his legs, he learned to push himself about by</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:192.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">leaning on a chair, his legs floundering. He graduated to the tail of the family mule, and eventually,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:209.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">hanging off the tail of an obliging horse named Paint, he began to run, a gait that initially caused him</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:226.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">excruciating pain. Within a few years, he was racing, setting mile records and obliterating his</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:261.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">legs and back were covered in a twisting mesh of scars, was becoming a national sensation, soon to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:278.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">be acclaimed as the greatest miler in American history. Louie had his hero.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:295.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In the fall of 1932, Pete began his studies at Compton, a tuition-free junior college, where he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:312.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">became a star runner. Nearly every afternoon, he commuted home to coach Louie, running alongside</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:330.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">him, subduing the jimmying elbows and teaching him strategy. Louie had a rare biomechanical</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:347.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">advantage, hips that rolled as he ran; when one leg reached forward, the corresponding hip swung</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:364.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">forward with it, giving Louie an exceptionally efficient, seven-foot stride. After watching him from</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:433.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In January 1933, Louie began tenth grade. As he lost his aloof, thorny manner, he was welcomed by</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:450.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the fashionable crowd. They invited him to weenie bakes in front of Kellow’s Hamburg Stand, where</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:174.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">crowd would roar. They turned into the homestretch for the last time dead together, Bright inside,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:192.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie outside. Ahead, a runner named John Casey was on the verge of being lapped. Officials waved</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:226.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Bright squeezed through on the inside, but Louie had to shift right to go around Casey. Confused,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:295.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">looked, to Pete’s eye, to be several yards. Louie took off after him, gaining rapidly. With the crowd</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:312.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">on its feet and screaming, Louie caught Bright at the tape. He was a beat too late: Bright won by a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:330.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">glimmer. He and Louie had clipped out the fastest 5,000 run in America in 1936. Louie’s Olympic</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:601.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was the hottest summer on record in America, and New York was one of the hardest-hit cities. In</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:192.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">On the night before the race, Louie lay sleepless in his sweltering hotel room. He was thinking</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:295.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">waiting for his race, baking under a scalding sun that, he said, “made a wreck of me.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:312.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">At last, they were told to line up. The gun cracked, the men rushed forward, and the race was on.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:330.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Lash bounded to the lead, with Bright in close pursuit. Louie dropped back, and the field settled in for</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:416.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">putting his foot through the radio. At last, the announcer listed the positions of the 5,000-meter</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:433.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">runners, but didn’t mention Louie. Unable to bear the tension, Louise fled to the kitchen, out of</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:468.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The runners pushed through laps seven, eight, nine. Lash and Bright led the field. Louie hovered in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:485.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the middle of the pack, waiting to make his move. The heat was suffocating. One runner dropped, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:502.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the others had no choice but to hurdle him. Then another went down, and they jumped him, too. Louie</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:519.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">could feel his feet cooking; the spikes on his shoes were conducting heat up from the track. Norman</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:537.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Bright’s feet were burning particularly badly. In terrible pain, he took a staggering step off the track,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:554.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">twisted his ankle, then lurched back on. The stumble seemed to finish him. He lost touch with Lash.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:571.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">When Louie and the rest of the pack came up to him, he had no resistance to offer. Still he ran on.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:588.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">As the runners entered the final lap, Lash gave himself a breather, dropping just behind his Indiana</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:606.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">teammate, Tom Deckard. Well behind him, Louie was ready to move. Angling into the backstretch, he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:623.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">accelerated. Lash’s back drew closer, and then it was just a yard or two ahead. Looking at the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:640.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">bobbing head of the mighty Don Lash, Louie felt intimidated. For several strides, he hesitated. Then</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:657.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">he saw the last curve ahead, and the sight slapped him awake. He opened up as fast as he could go.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:675.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Banking around the turn, Louie drew alongside Lash just as Lash shifted right to pass Deckard.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:692.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie was carried three-wide, losing precious ground. Leaving Deckard behind, Louie and Lash ran</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:709.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">side by side into the homestretch. With one hundred yards to go, Louie held a slight lead. Lash,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:726.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">fighting furiously, stuck with him. Neither man had any more speed to give. Louie could see that he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:744.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was maybe a hand’s width ahead, and he wouldn’t let it go.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:761.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">With heads thrown back, legs pumping out of sync, Louie and Lash drove for the tape. With just a</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:390.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">that Louie would take that record down. The only runner who could beat him, the coach said, was</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:441.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">with reporters after winning a race. “There’s the next mile champion,” he said, leveling his eyes</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:579.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">run a mile, he wrote, was 4:01.6.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:597.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Pete disagreed. Since the Olympics, he’d been certain that Louie had a four-minute mile in him.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:614.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie had always shaken this off, but in the spring of ’38, he reconsidered. His coach had forbidden</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:648.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">buy the warnings. Every night that May, he climbed the coliseum fence, dropped into the stadium, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:666.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">ran the stairs until his legs went numb. By June, his body was humming, capable of speed and stamina</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:683.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">beyond anything he’d ever known. He began to think that Pete was right, and he wasn’t alone. Running</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:54.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">performance. On the night before the race, a coach from Notre Dame knocked on Louie’s hotel room</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:88.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">runners to sharpen their spikes and slash him. Louie dismissed the warning, certain that no one would</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">do such a thing deliberately.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:123.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">He was wrong. Halfway through the race, just as Louie was about to move for the lead, several</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The first thing people tended to notice about Phillips was that they hadn’t noticed him earlier. He</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:140.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">He was smallish, short-legged. Some of the men called him Sandblaster because, said one pilot, “his</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:192.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">contributed to his invisibility, but what really did it was his silence. Phillips was an amiable man and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:209.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was, judging by his letters, highly articulate, but he preferred not to speak. You could park him in a</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:69.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">drowned themselves. Tooling around the island in borrowed cars, they came upon several airfields,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:87.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">but when they drew closer, they realized that all of the planes and equipment were fake, made of</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:121.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">found their Everest. It was the House of P. Y. Chong steakhouse, where for $2.50 they could get a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:138.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">steak nearly as fat as a man’s arm and as broad as his head. Louie never saw a Chong diner finish his</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:190.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">were tennis courts, pretty girls with ten-thirty curfews, and boilermakers. When the crew got the best</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:2.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">One day on the club’s dance floor, Louie spotted the lieutenant who had ordered them to fly on three</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:19.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">engines. He scrounged up a bag of flour, recruited a girl, and began dancing in circles near the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:36.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">lieutenant, dropping a pinch of flour down the officer’s collar each time he swung past. After an hour</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:54.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">of this, the whole club was watching. Finally, Louie snagged a glass of water, danced up behind his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:71.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">victim, dumped the water down his shirt, and took off. The lieutenant spun around, his back running</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:88.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">with dough. Unable to find the culprit, he stormed out, and Louie was the toast of the club. “We had</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">one more girl for us,” he said.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:123.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">November became December, and the crew still hadn’t seen any Japanese. There was hard fighting</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:140.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">down on Guadalcanal, and the men felt excluded, frustrated, and intensely curious about combat.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:157.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Every time a B-17 was brought up from the fighting, Louie and his friends went to the airfield to gawk</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:174.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">at it. At first, all the planes looked the same. Then an airman showed them a lone bullet hole. “My</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:192.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">golly!” Louie said later. “Our hair stood on end.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:291.01px;top:224.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">——</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:256.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Three days before Christmas, the crew’s hour finally came. They and twenty-five other crews were</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:273.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">told to pack three days’ worth of clothes and report to their planes. Walking out to </span><span class="cls_002">Super Man</span><span class="cls_004">, Louie</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">found the bomb bay fitted with two auxiliary fuel tanks and six five-hundred-pound bombs. Judging by</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:308.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the auxiliary tanks, Louie wrote in his diary, their destination was likely “a long hop somewhere.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:325.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Instead of the Norden bombsight, Louie was given the handheld sight, which probably meant that</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:342.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">they’d be dive-bombing. The crew was handed a packet of orders and told not to open them until</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:377.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Five minutes after </span><span class="cls_002">Super Man</span><span class="cls_004"> lifted off, the crewmen tore open the orders and learned that they</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:394.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">were to make a heading for Midway. When they landed there eight hours later, they were greeted with</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:411.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">a case of Budweiser and very big news: The Japanese had built a base on Wake Atoll. In the biggest</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:429.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">raid yet staged in the Pacific war, the AAF was going to burn the base down.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:446.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The next afternoon, the crew was called to the briefing room, which was actually the base theater,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:463.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">strung with limp Christmas tinsel and streamers. They were going to hit Wake that night, with dive-</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:480.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">bombing. The mission would take sixteen hours, nonstop, the longest combat flight the war had yet</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:498.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">seen. This would push the B-24s as far as they could go. Even with auxiliary fuel tanks, they would</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:515.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">be cutting it extremely close.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:532.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Before the flight, Louie walked to the airfield. The ground crewmen were preparing the planes,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:549.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">stripping out every ounce of excess weight and rolling black paint on the bellies and wings to make</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:567.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">them harder to see against a night sky. Coming to </span><span class="cls_002">Super Man</span><span class="cls_004">, Louie climbed into the bomb bay,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:584.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">where the bombs sat ready. In honor of his college buddy Payton Jordan, who had just married his</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:653.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">procession. All afternoon and into the evening, the planes flew toward Wake. The sun set, and the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:670.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">bombers pressed on under the timid glow of moon and stars.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">lights. Clouds closed in. The bombers were supposed to approach the atoll in formation, but with</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:722.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">clouds around and the lights off, the pilots couldn’t find their flightmates. They couldn’t risk breaking</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:739.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">radio silence, so each plane went on alone. The pilots craned into the dark, swerving away from the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:756.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">faint shadows of others, trying to avoid collisions. Wake was very close now, but they couldn’t see it.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:187.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">altitude figures, Matheny pushed his plane toward a string of buildings on Peacock Point, the atoll’s</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:204.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">southern tip. On either side of Matheny’s plane, B-24s followed him down. When he reached his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:222.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">bombing altitude, Matheny hauled the plane’s nose up and yelled to the bombardier.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:515.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">large infernos, spewing black smoke, were consuming the atoll’s oil tanks. Everywhere, bombs were</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:532.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">striking targets, sending up mushrooms of fire. Searchlights swung about, their beams reflecting off</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:567.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">undergarments, sprinting around in confusion. What neither Pillsbury nor any of the other airmen knew</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:584.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was that among the men under their bombers that night were the ninety-eight Americans who had been</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:636.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">pieces. To Pillsbury, “every gun in the world” seemed to be firing skyward. Antiaircraft guns lobbed</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:312.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Phil did what he could. Slowing the engines on one side created a power differential that forced</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:71.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">reached the selector valve. Together, they got the gear down while Louie peered out the side window,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:123.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the air whooshed around, carrying an acrid smell. Trees blew apart. A bomb struck the tent in which</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:157.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">something speared into the back of the man on top. He said, “This feels like it, boys,” and passed out.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:174.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">A bomb hit the ordnance truck, sending it into the air in thousands of pieces. The remains of the truck</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:243.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">a tail gunner. It didn’t go off, but sat there hissing. The gunner shouted, “Jesus!” It took them a moment</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:261.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to realize that what they’d thought was a bomb was actually a fire extinguisher. Yards away, Louie</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:502.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">it was over them again, tremendous crashing. The ceiling shuddered, and cement dust sifted down.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:519.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Outside, it was hell on earth. Men moaned and screamed, one calling for his mother. A pilot</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:537.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">thought the voices sounded “like animals crying.” Men’s eardrums burst. A man died of a heart attack.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:367.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">When Phil said that the plane wasn’t airworthy, the lieutenant replied that it had passed inspection.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:639.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">been anywhere. Whatever his reason, he told Phil to follow a heading of 208 and search to a point</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:656.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">parallel to Palmyra. He gave Deasy roughly the same instruction but directed him to a slightly</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:673.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">different area. Both crews were told to search all day, land at Palmyra, then resume searching the next</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:36.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">those on the other, making one side progressively lighter. They began transferring fuel across the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Then it stopped. The bomber tipped left and began dropping rapidly toward the ocean.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:123.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Phil and Cuppernell had only seconds to save the plane. They began working rapidly, but Louie</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:140.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">had the sense that they were disoriented by their seat swap. To minimize drag from the dead No. 1</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:157.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">engine, they needed to “feather” it—turn the dead propeller blades parallel to the wind and stop the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:174.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">propeller’s rotation. Normally, this was Cuppernell’s job, but now he was in the pilot’s seat. As he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:192.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">worked, Cuppernell shouted to the new engineer to come to the cockpit to feather the engine. It is</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:209.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">unknown if he or anyone else specified which engine needed feathering. It was a critical piece of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:226.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">information; because a dead engine’s propeller continues turning in the wind, it can look just like a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:243.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">running engine.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:261.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">On the control panel, there were four feathering buttons, one for each engine, covered by a plastic</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:278.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">shield. Leaning between Cuppernell and Phil, the engineer flipped the shield and banged down on a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:295.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">button. The moment he did it, </span><span class="cls_002">Green Hornet</span><span class="cls_004"> heaved and lurched left. The engineer had hit the No. 2</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:2.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie sat down on the floor by the bulkhead, facing forward. There were five men near him.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:36.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was the cloudy sky, turning around and around. He felt intensely alive. He recalled the bulkhead in</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">One terrible, tumbling second passed, then another. An instant before the plane struck the water,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:123.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie’s mind throbbed with a single, final thought: </span><span class="cls_002">Nobody’s going to live through this</span><span class="cls_004">.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:291.01px;top:155.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">——</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:187.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">For Louie, there were only jagged, soundless sensations: his body catapulted forward, the plane</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:204.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">breaking open, something wrapping itself around him, the cold slap of water, and then its weight over</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:256.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">As the plane disintegrated around him, Louie felt himself being pulled deep underwater. Then,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:273.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">abruptly, the downward motion stopped and Louie was flung upward. The force of the plane’s plunge</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">had spent itself, and the fuselage, momentarily buoyed by the air trapped inside, leapt to the surface.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:308.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie opened his mouth and gasped. The air hissed from the plane, and the water rushed up over</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:325.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie again. The plane slipped under and sank toward the ocean floor as if yanked downward.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:342.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie tried to orient himself. The tail was no longer behind him, the wings no longer ahead. The</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:360.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">men who’d been around him were gone. The impact had rammed him into the waist gun mount and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:377.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">wedged him under it, facedown, with the raft below him. The gun mount pressed against his neck, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:394.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">countless strands of something were coiled around his body, binding him to the gun mount and the raft.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:411.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">He felt them and thought: </span><span class="cls_002">Spaghetti</span><span class="cls_004">. It was a snarl of wires, </span><span class="cls_002">Green Hornet</span><span class="cls_004">’s nervous system. When</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:429.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the tail had broken off, the wires had snapped and whipped around him. He thrashed against them but</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:446.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">couldn’t get free. He felt frantic to breathe, but couldn’t.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:463.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In the remains of the cockpit, Phil was fighting to get out. When the plane hit, he was thrown</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:480.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">forward, his head striking something. A wave of water punched through the cockpit, and the plane</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:498.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">carried him under. From the darkness, he knew that he was far below the surface, sinking deeper by</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:515.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the second. He apparently saw Cuppernell push his big body out of the plane. Phil found what he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:532.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">thought was the cockpit window frame, its glass missing. He put his foot on something hard and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:549.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">pushed himself through the opening and out of the cockpit. He swam toward the surface, the light</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:567.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">coming up around him.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:584.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">He emerged in a puzzle of debris. His head was gushing blood and his ankle and one finger were</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:601.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">broken. He found a floating hunk of wreckage, perhaps four feet square, and clung to it. It began to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:618.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">sink. There were two life rafts far away. No one was in them. Cuppernell was nowhere to be seen.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:636.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Far below, Louie was still ensnared in the plane, writhing in the wires. He looked up and saw a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:653.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">body, drifting passively. The plane coursed down, and the world fled away above. Louie felt his ears</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:670.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">pop, and vaguely recollected that at the swimming pool at Redondo Beach, his ears would pop at</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:687.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">twenty feet. Darkness enfolded him, and the water pressure bore in with greater and greater intensity.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">He struggled uselessly. He thought: </span><span class="cls_002">Hopeless</span><span class="cls_004">.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:722.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">He felt a sudden, excruciating bolt of pain in his forehead. There was an oncoming stupor, a fading,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:739.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">as he tore at the wires and clenched his throat against the need to breathe. He had the soft realization</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:19.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">dropping weight of the plane around him. Inexplicably, the wires were gone, as was the raft. He was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:36.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">floating inside the fuselage, which was bearing him toward the ocean floor, some seventeen hundred</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:54.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">feet down. He could see nothing. His Mae West was uninflated, but its buoyancy was pulling him into</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:71.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the ceiling of the plane. The air was gone from his lungs, and he was now gulping reflexively,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:88.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">swallowing salt water. He tasted blood, gasoline, and oil. He was drowning.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie flung out his arms, trying to find a way out. His right hand struck something, and his USC ring</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:123.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">snagged on it. His hand was caught. He reached toward it with his left hand and felt a long, smooth</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:140.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">length of metal. The sensation oriented him: He was at the open right waist window. He swam into</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:157.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the window, put his feet on the frame, and pushed off, wrenching his right hand free and cutting his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:174.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">finger. His back struck the top of the window, and the skin under his shirt scraped off. He kicked</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:212.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">spouted in rhythmic arcs from Phil’s head and washed in sheets down his face. His eyes lolled about</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:229.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">in dazed bewilderment. Phil looked at the head bobbing across the debris field and registered that it</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:246.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was Louie. None of the other men had surfaced.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:264.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie saw one of the life rafts bobbing on the water. It was possible that the raft had been thrown</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:281.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">loose by the disintegrating plane, but it was much more likely that the engineer, in the last act of his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:298.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">life, had yanked the raft-release handle just before the crash. The raft had inflated itself and was</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:333.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie knew that he had to get Phil’s bleeding stopped, but if he went to him, the raft would be lost</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:350.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and all of them would perish. He swam for the raft. His clothing and shoes weighed him down, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:367.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the current and wind carried the raft away faster than he could swim. As it slipped farther and farther</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:384.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">from reach, Louie gave up. He looked back at Phil and Mac, sharing the recognition that their chance</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:402.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was lost. Then he saw a long cord trailing off the raft, snaking not two feet from his face. He snatched</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:419.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the cord, reeled the raft to him, and climbed aboard. A second raft was sliding away. Louie pulled out</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:436.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">his raft’s oars, rowed as hard as he could, and just managed to catch the cord and pull the raft to him.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:574.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">learned in Boy Scouts and his Honolulu first aid course, Louie ran his fingers down Phil’s throat until</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:222.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">were still on their wrists, but the hands had stopped when the plane had hit the water. Probably for</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:522.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">had hit. The search area would have to be enormous.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:123.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">useless. There was no bait.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:140.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">As the men lay in silence, a purring sound began drifting gently between their thoughts. Then all</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:157.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">three realized that they were hearing a plane. Searching the sky, they saw a B-25, high up and well to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:174.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the east. Flying much too high to be a search plane, it was probably on its way to Palmyra.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:192.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie lunged for the raft pocket, retrieved the flare gun, and loaded a flare cartridge. He couldn’t</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:226.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">trigger, the gun bucked in his hand, and the flare, roaring red, streaked up. As it shot overhead, Louie</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:243.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">dug out a dye pack and shook it hurriedly into the water, and a pool of vivid greenish yellow bloomed</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:312.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">of color around the rafts faded away.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">drifting west, away from the view of friendly planes. Their chances of rescue were already dimming.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:416.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">That evening, the search planes turned back for their bases. No one had seen anything. They would</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:601.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">whale of a plane, heading southeast, plowing through the clouds, disappearing and reappearing. It</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:618.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was a search plane. It was so near the rafts that Louie thought he recognized the insignia of their</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:636.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">squadron, the 42nd, on the plane’s tail.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:653.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie grabbed the flare gun, loaded it, and fired. The flare shot straight at the bomber; for a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:670.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">moment, the men thought that it would hit the plane. But the flare missed, passing alongside the plane,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:687.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">making a fountain of red that looked huge from the raft. Louie reloaded and fired again. The plane</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">turned sharply right. Louie fired two more flares, past the tail.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:756.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">offering the men only brief glimpses of the sea. Everyone felt a particular urgency; the missing men</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:239.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">did nothing at all. Then he started speaking to his fellow officers. Jordan’s job was to train cadets in</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:264.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The water cans were empty. Desperately thirsty and overheated, the men could do no more than use</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:298.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">answered, for the sharks circled. One shark, six or eight feet long, stalked the rafts without rest, day</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:402.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">tongues. It soothed their skin, washed the salt and sweat and fuel from their pores, slid down their</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:419.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">throats, fed their bodies. It was a sensory explosion.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:436.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">They knew it wouldn’t last. They had to find a way to save the water. The narrow water tins,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:471.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">open, felt around the raft for something better. He dug into the raft pockets and pulled out one of the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:488.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">air pumps. It was sheathed in a canvas case about fourteen inches long, stitched down one side. He</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:505.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">tore the seam open, spread the fabric to form a triangular bowl, and watched happily as the rain</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:540.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">He had collected some two pints of water when a whitecap cracked into the raft, crested over, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:557.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">slopped into the canvas, spoiling the water. Not only had the most productive part of the storm been</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:574.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">wasted, but the canvas had to be rinsed in the rain before Louie could resume capturing water. Even</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:591.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">when that was done, there was no way to avoid the next whitecap, because Louie couldn’t see them</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:626.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie tried a new technique. Instead of allowing large pools of water to gather, he began</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:643.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">continuously sucking the captured water into his mouth, then spitting it in the cans. Once the cans were</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:660.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">full, he kept harvesting the rain, giving one man a drink every thirty seconds or so. They tore open the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:678.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">second pump case to form another rain catcher. When the sun emerged, they found that the canvas</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:695.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">cases also made excellent hats. They began rotations with them, two men in, one man out.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:468.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">hook to a line, baited it, and fed it into the water. In a moment, a shark cruised by, bit down on the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:485.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">hook, and severed the line, taking the bait, the hook, and a foot or two of line with him. Louie tried</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:502.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">with another hook, and again, a shark took it. A third try produced the same result. Finally, the sharks</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:519.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">let a hook hang unmolested. Louie felt a tug and pulled up the line. On its end hung a slender pilot</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:537.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">fish, about ten inches long. As Louie pulled it apart, everyone felt apprehensive. None of them had</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:554.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">eaten raw fish before. They each put a bit of meat into their mouths. It was flavorless. They ate it</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:571.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">down to the bones.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:588.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">It was the first food to cross their lips in more than a week. Between three men, a small fish didn’t</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:606.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">go far, but the protein gave them a push of energy. Louie had demonstrated that if they were persistent</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:623.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and resourceful, they could catch food, and both he and Phil felt inspired. Only Mac remained</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:640.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">unchanged.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:657.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Phil felt uneasy about the albatross. Like many schoolboys of his era, he had read Samuel Taylor</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:709.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">windless waters, tormented by thirst and monstrous creatures. The crewmen all die, and the sailor is</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:726.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">left in a hellish limbo, the albatross hung about his neck, his eyes closed against the accusing stares of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:744.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">his dead crewmen.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:761.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie wasn’t superstitious, but he’d grown fond of albatrosses on that Christmas he’d spent</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:19.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">albatross was said to bring bad luck. After a plane crash, Louie replied, what more bad luck could</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:101.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Several more days passed. Louie caught nothing, and his hook supply dwindled. No more birds</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:118.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">landed on the raft. Periodically, rain replenished the water tins, but only partway.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:135.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The men floated in a sensory vacuum. When the weather was calm, the ocean was silent. There</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:153.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was nothing to touch but water, skin, hair, and canvas. Other than the charred smell of the raft, there</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:170.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">were no odors. There was nothing to look at but sky and sea. At some point, Louie stuck his finger in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:187.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">his ear and felt wax there. He smelled his finger, and by virtue of being new, the scent of the wax was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:204.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">curiously refreshing. He developed a habit of twisting his finger in his ear and sniffing it. Phil began</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:222.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">doing it too.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:239.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">When Louie slept, he dreamed of being on land, trying to sleep, but there was never a place to rest</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:256.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">safely—only rocks, sucking mud, beds of cactus. He would be on perilous cliffs or unstable boulders,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:273.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and the ground would heave and shift under his weight. Phil was having the same dreams.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">As time passed, Phil began thinking about an article, written by the World War I ace pilot Eddie</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:308.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Rickenbacker, that he had read in </span><span class="cls_002">Life</span><span class="cls_004"> magazine that winter. The previous October, a B-17 carrying</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:325.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Rickenbacker and a crew over the Pacific had become lost and run out of fuel. The pilot had ditched</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:342.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the plane, and it had floated long enough for the men to get into rafts. The men had drifted for weeks,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:360.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">surviving on stores in the rafts, rainwater, fish, and bird meat. One man had died, and the rest had</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:377.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">hallucinated, babbling at invisible companions, singing bizarre songs, arguing about where to pull</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:394.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">over the imaginary car in which they were riding. One lieutenant had been visited by a specter who</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:411.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">had tried to lure him to the bottom of the ocean. Finally, the rafts had split up, and one had reached an</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:429.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">island. Natives had radioed to Funafuti, and the other men had been rescued.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:446.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">It seemed that Rickenbacker’s crew had stretched the capacity for human survival as far as it</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:463.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">would go. Rickenbacker had written that he had drifted for twenty-one days (he had actually drifted</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:480.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">for twenty-four), and Phil, Louie, and Mac believed that this was a survival record. In fact, the record</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:498.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">for inflated raft survival appears to have been set in 1942, when three navy plane crash victims</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:515.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">survived for thirty-four days on the Pacific before reaching an island, where they were sheltered by</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:552.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">At first, Phil gave no thought to counting days, but when time stretched on, he began paying</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:569.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">attention to how long they’d been out there. He had no trouble counting days without confusion;</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:586.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">because they were on the raft for only part of the day they crashed, Phil and Louie counted the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:603.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">following day as day 1. With each new day, Phil told himself that surely they’d be picked up before</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:621.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">reaching Rickenbacker’s mark. When he considered what they’d do if they passed that mark, he had</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:638.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">no answer.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:655.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Rickenbacker’s story, familiar to Louie also, was important for another reason. Exposure,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:672.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">dehydration, stress, and hunger had quickly driven many of Rickenbacker’s party insane, a common</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:690.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">fate for raft-bound men. Louie was more concerned about sanity than he was about sustenance. He</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:707.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">kept thinking of a college physiology class he had taken, in which the instructor had taught them to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:724.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">think of the mind as a muscle that would atrophy if left idle. Louie was determined that no matter what</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:741.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">happened to their bodies, their minds would stay under their control.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:2.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">conceivable subject. Phil took up the challenge, and soon he and Louie turned the raft into a nonstop</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:19.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">quiz show. They shared their histories, from first memories onward, recounted in minute detail. Louie</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:36.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">told of his days at USC; Phil spoke of Indiana. They recalled the best dates they’d ever had. They told</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:54.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and retold stories of practical jokes that they’d played on each other. Every answer was followed by</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:71.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">a question. Phil sang church hymns; Louie taught the other two the lyrics to “White Christmas.” They</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:88.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">sang it over the ocean, a holiday song in June, heard only by circling sharks.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Every conversation meandered back to food. Louie had often boasted to Phil about his mother’s</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:123.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">cooking, and at some point, Phil asked Louie to describe how she made a meal. Louie began</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:140.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">describing a dish, and all three men found it satisfying, so Louie kept going, telling them about each</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:157.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">dish in the greatest possible detail. Soon, Louise’s kitchen floated there with them: Sauces simmered,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:174.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">spices were pinched and scattered, butter melted on tongues.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:192.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">So began a thrice-daily ritual on the raft, with pumpkin pie and spaghetti being the favorite</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:209.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">subjects. The men came to know Louise’s recipes so well that if Louie skipped a step or forgot an</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:226.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">ingredient, Phil, and sometimes Mac, would quickly correct him and make him start over. When the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:243.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">imaginary meal was prepared, the men would devour every crumb, describing each mouthful. They</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:261.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">conjured up the scene in such vivid detail that somehow their stomachs were fooled by it, if only</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:278.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">briefly.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:295.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Once the food was eaten and the past exhausted, they moved to the future. Louie laid plans to buy</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:312.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the Torrance train depot and turn it into a restaurant. Phil fantasized about getting back to Indiana,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:330.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">maybe to teach school. He couldn’t wait to see the Indy 500 again. The race had been suspended</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:347.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">because of the war, but Phil revived it in his mind, spreading a blanket on the infield grass, heaping it</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:364.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">with food, and watching the cars blur past. And he thought about Cecy. It hadn’t occurred to him to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">tuck her picture in his wallet before he left the cottage, but in his mind, she never left him.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">For Louie and Phil, the conversations were healing, pulling them out of their suffering and setting</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:416.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the future before them as a concrete thing. As they imagined themselves back in the world again, they</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:433.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">willed a happy ending onto their ordeal and made it their expectation. With these talks, they created</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:450.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">something to live for.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:468.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In all of these bull sessions, not once did they broach the subject of the crash. Louie wanted to talk</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:485.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">about it, but something about Phil stopped him. There were times when Phil seemed lost in troubled</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:502.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">thoughts, and Louie guessed that he was reliving the crash, and perhaps holding himself responsible</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:519.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">for the deaths of his men. Louie wanted to reassure Phil that he’d done nothing wrong, but he decided</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:537.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">that raising the issue would deepen Phil’s preoccupation. So he said nothing.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:291.01px;top:569.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">——</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:601.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">As Louie and Phil grilled each other, Mac usually sat in silence. Sometimes he’d ask Louie to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:618.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">describe a recipe, and occasionally he would interject, but getting him to fully participate was rough</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:636.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">going. He shared few memories, and though the other two encouraged him, he couldn’t imagine a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:653.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">future. To him, it seemed, the world was too far gone.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:670.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Given the dismal record of raft-bound men, Mac’s despair was reasonable. What is remarkable is</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:687.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">that the two men who shared Mac’s plight didn’t share his hopelessness. Though Phil was constantly</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">wondering how long this would go on, it had not yet occurred to him that he might die. The same was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:722.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">true for Louie. Though they both knew that they were in an extremely serious situation, both had the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:739.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">ability to warn fear away from their thoughts, focusing instead on how to survive and reassuring</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:71.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">that he may have been a born optimist. Perhaps the men’s histories had given them opposing</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:88.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">convictions about their capacity to overcome adversity. Phil and Louie had survived Funafuti and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">performed uncommonly well over Nauru, and each trusted the other. “If there was one thing left, he’d</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:123.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">a given it to me,” Phil once said of Louie. Mac had never seen combat, didn’t know these officers,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:140.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and was largely an unknown quantity to himself. All he knew about his ability to cope with this crisis</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:157.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was that on the first night, he had panicked and eaten the only food they had. As time passed and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:174.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">starvation loomed, this act took on greater and greater importance, and it may have fed Mac’s sense</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:192.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">of futility.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:209.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">For Phil, there was another source of strength, one of which even Louie was unaware. According</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:226.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to his family, in his quiet, private way, Phil was a deeply religious man, carrying a faith instilled in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:243.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">him by his parents. “I had told Al several times before to always do his best as he knew how to do</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:261.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">it,” Phil’s father once wrote, “and when things get beyond his skill and ability to ask the Lord to step</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:278.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">in and help out.” Phil never spoke of his faith, but as he sang hymns over the ocean, conjuring up a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:295.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">protective God, perhaps rescue felt closer, despair more distant.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:312.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">From earliest childhood, Louie had regarded every limitation placed on him as a challenge to his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:330.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">wits, his resourcefulness, and his determination to rebel. The result had been a mutinous youth. As</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:347.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">maddening as his exploits had been for his parents and his town, Louie’s success in carrying them off</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:364.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">had given him the conviction that he could think his way around any boundary. Now, as he was cast</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">into extremity, despair and death became the focus of his defiance. The same attributes that had made</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:416.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Though all three men faced the same hardship, their differing perceptions of it appeared to be</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:433.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">shaping their fates. Louie and Phil’s hope displaced their fear and inspired them to work toward their</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:450.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">survival, and each success renewed their physical and emotional vigor. Mac’s resignation seemed to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:468.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">paralyze him, and the less he participated in their efforts to survive, the more he slipped. Though he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:485.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">did the least, as the days passed, it was he who faded the most. Louie and Phil’s optimism, and Mac’s</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:502.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">hopelessness, were becoming self-fulfilling.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:567.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Two weeks had passed. The men’s skin was burned, swollen, and cracked. Mysterious white lines</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:601.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The rafts were decomposing in the sun and salt water, bleeding vivid yellow dye onto the men’s</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:636.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The men’s bodies slowly winnowed. Each day, Louie noticed incremental differences in his</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:36.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">cannibalism has always inspired revulsion. To many sailors who have stood on the threshold of</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:88.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">For Louie, the idea of consuming a human being was revolting and unthinkable. To eat a human</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:123.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">conviction. Cannibalism wouldn’t be considered, then or ever.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:140.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The two-week mark was a different kind of turning point for Louie. He began to pray aloud. He had</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:157.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">no idea how to speak to God, so he recited snippets of prayers that he’d heard in movies. Phil bowed</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:325.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">didn’t smell that bad. Still, no one wanted to eat it. Louie portioned the meat and insisted that</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:342.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">everyone eat. All three men forced the meat down. Because Mac seemed to need food the most, they</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:631.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">coming from Phil’s head. The blood on his T-shirt bandage was rotting, and cakes of it were chipping</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:648.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">off and falling into the raft. Phil couldn’t smell it, but Louie couldn’t bear it. Louie untied the T-shirt</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:666.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and gently unwrapped it. Beneath a thick cake of dried blood, the wounds had knit neatly. The</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:683.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">bleeding didn’t resume. The T-shirt could go.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:700.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">A few days later, Louie saw something bizarre. The edge of the sea, flush to the horizon, was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:717.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">peeling upward. A vast black rim formed, rose up, and began speeding toward them with a tumbling</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:735.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">motion. Louie shouted a warning and the other two men wheeled around toward it. They dropped</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:752.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">down, getting their weight as low as possible so they wouldn’t be flipped over. As the wave closed</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:36.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">dolphins, swimming with astonishing speed. The dolphins rushed at the rafts and were soon muscling</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:54.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">all around them. Looking into the water, Phil saw small fish, thousands of them, seeming to fill the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:71.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">ocean. The dolphins were chasing them. The men thrust their arms into the water and tried to grab</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:88.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">some, but the fish slipped through their fingers. If they had had a net, they could have whisked it</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">through the water and filled the rafts. But with only their fingers, they couldn’t snare even one.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:123.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie was out of bait. Other than the sharks, the only fish that ventured near the rafts were pilot</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:140.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">fish, which hugged the sides of the sharks as they circled. They were within easy reach, only when</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:157.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie tried to grab them, they squirted away. The sharks had stolen every hook small enough to fit in</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:192.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Looking at the fish line that he had left, he got an idea. He cut off small portions of line, tied them to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:209.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the large fishhooks, and then tied three hooks to the fingers of one hand, one on his pinkie, one on his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:226.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">middle finger, one on his thumb, orienting them as if they were claws. He held his hand over the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:243.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">water’s surface and waited.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:261.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">A shark, attended by a pilot fish, swam by. Once its head had passed, Louie sank his hand into the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:278.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">water. When the unsuspecting pilot fish moved under his hand, he snapped his fingers shut around its</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:312.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Sometime that week, a small tern landed on the wall of the raft, right between the men. It was</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:347.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">down on the bird. It was tiny, and offered little meat, but not long after, another tern settled on the raft.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:364.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">This time, Mac caught it. Louie was so famished that he went at it with his teeth, ripping the feathers</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">loose and spitting them out in whuffs. Almost immediately, he felt a crawling sensation on his chin.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The tern had been covered in lice, which were now hopping over his face.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:433.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">encountered. He began scratching and rubbing at his face, but he couldn’t get at the lice, which had</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:450.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">burrowed into his beard and were moving up his head and into his hair. He pitched his upper body</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:468.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">into the water. Phil and Mac, realizing that Louie was going to get his head ripped off, grabbed the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:519.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">As the days passed, the men caught three, perhaps four more birds. One bird kept dipping low over</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:687.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">reached it, leaving them exhausted and demoralized. When the next squall inched along the horizon,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:177.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">conferred and voted. They decided to take a shot.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:436.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">around them. Then the firing stopped.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:522.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie swam up behind him and gave him a push, and Phil slopped up on board. Mac, too, needed</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:591.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In the distance, the bomber swung around and began flying at the rafts again. Louie hoped that the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:643.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">into view. All three men saw it at once. Behind the wing, painted over the waist, was a red circle.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:660.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The bomber was Japanese.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:678.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie saw the gunners taking aim and knew he had to go back in the water. Phil and Mac didn’t</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:712.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">strong enough to get back in, and the sharks would take them. If they stayed on the raft, it seemed</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:36.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">through the canvas, shooting beams of intensely bright tropical sunlight through the raft’s shadow. But</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:54.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">after a few feet, the bullets spent their force and fluttered down, fizzing. Louie straightened his arms</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:71.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">over his head and pushed against the bottom of one of the rafts, trying to get far enough down to be</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:88.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">outside the bullets’ lethal range. Above him, he could see the depressions formed by Mac and Phil’s</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">bodies. Neither man was moving.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:123.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">As the bullets raked overhead, Louie struggled to stay under the rafts. The current clutched at him,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:140.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">rotating his body horizontally and dragging him away. He kicked against it, but it was no use. He was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:157.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">being sucked away, and he knew that if he lost touch with the rafts, he wouldn’t be able to swim hard</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:174.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">enough against the current to get back. As he was pulled loose, he saw the long cord that strayed off</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:192.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the end of one of the rafts. He grabbed it and tied it around his waist.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:209.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">As he lay underwater, his legs tugged in front of him by the current, Louie looked down at his feet.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:226.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">His left sock was pulled up on his shin; his right had slipped halfway off. He watched it flap in the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:243.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">current. Then, in the murky blur beyond it, he saw the huge, gaping mouth of a shark emerge out of the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:261.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">darkness and rush straight at his legs.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:278.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie recoiled, pulling his legs toward his body. The current was too strong for him to get his legs</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:295.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">beneath him, but he was able to swing them to the side, away from the shark’s mouth. The shark kept</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:312.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">coming, directly at Louie’s head. Louie remembered the advice of the old man in Honolulu: Make a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:330.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">threatening expression, then stiff-arm the shark’s snout. As the shark lunged for his head, Louie bared</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:347.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">his teeth, widened his eyes, and rammed his palm into the tip of the shark’s nose. The shark flinched,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:364.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">circled away, then swam back for a second pass. Louie waited until the shark was inches from him,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">then struck it in the nose again. Again, the shark peeled away.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Above, the bullets had stopped coming. As quickly as he could, Louie pulled himself along the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:416.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">cord until he reached the raft. He grabbed its wall and lifted himself clear of the shark.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:433.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Mac and Phil were lying together in the fetal position. They were absolutely still, and bullet holes</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:468.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">said no. Louie spoke to Phil. Phil said he was okay.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:485.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The bomber circled back for another go. Phil and Mac played dead, and Louie tipped back into the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:502.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">ocean. As bullets knifed the water around him, the shark came at him, and again Louie bumped its</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:519.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">snout and repelled it. Then a second shark charged at him. Louie hung there, gyrating in the water and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:537.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">flailing his arms and legs, as the sharks snapped at him and the bullets came down. The moment the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:554.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">bomber sped out of firing range, he clambered onto the raft again. Phil and Mac were still unhit.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:571.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Four more times the Japanese strafed them, sending Louie into the water to kick and punch at the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:588.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">sharks until the bomber had passed. Though he fought them to the point of exhaustion, he was not</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:606.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">bitten. Every time he emerged from the water, he was certain that Phil and Mac would be dead.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:66.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Phil’s raft had been slashed in two. A bullet had struck the air pump and ricocheted straight across the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:84.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">base of the raft, slitting it from end to end. Everything that had been in the raft had been lost in the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:101.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">water. Because the ruined raft was made from rubberized canvas, it didn’t sink, but it was obviously</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:118.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">far beyond repair. Shrunken and formless, it lapped about on the ocean surface.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:135.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The men were sardined together on what remained of Mac and Louie’s raft, which was far too</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:153.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">small for all three of them. The canvas was speckled with tiny bullet holes. The raft had two air</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:170.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">chambers, but both were punctured. Each time one of the men moved, air sighed out of the chambers</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:187.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and the canvas wrinkled a little more. The raft sat lower and lower in the water. The sharks whipped</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:204.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">around it, surely excited by the bullets, the sight and smell of men in the water, and the sinking raft.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:222.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">As the men sat together, exhausted and in shock, a shark lunged up over a wall of the raft, mouth</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:239.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">open, trying to drag a man into the ocean. Someone grabbed an oar and hit the shark, and it slid off.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:256.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Then another shark jumped on and, after it, another. The men gripped the oars and wheeled about,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:273.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">frantically swinging at the sharks. As they turned and swung and the sharks flopped up, air was forced</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">out of the bullet holes, and the raft sank deeper. Soon, part of the raft was completely submerged.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:308.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">If the men didn’t get air into the raft immediately, the sharks would take them. One pump had been</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:325.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">lost in the strafing; only the one from Mac and Louie’s raft remained. The men hooked it up to one of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:342.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the two valves and took turns pumping as hard as they could. Air flowed into the chamber and seeped</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:360.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">out through the bullet holes, but the men found that if they pumped very quickly, just enough air passed</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:377.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">through the raft to lift it up in the water and keep it mostly inflated. The sharks kept coming, and the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:394.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">men kept beating them away.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:411.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">As Phil and Mac pumped and struck at the sharks, Louie groped for the provisions pocket and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:429.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">grabbed the patching kit, which contained sheets of patching material, a tube of glue, and sandpaper to</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:498.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">raft. He had to devise something that could etch up the patch area so the glue would stick. He</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:515.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">pondered the problem, then picked up the brass mirror that he had used to hail the bomber. Using the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:532.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">pliers, he cut three teeth into the edge of the mirror. Phil and Mac kept fighting the sharks off.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:549.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie began patching, starting with the holes on the top of the raft. He lifted the perforated area</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:567.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">clear of the water, wiped the water from the surface, and held it away from the waves, letting it dry in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:584.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the sun. Then, with each perforation, he used the mirror edge to cut an X across the hole. The material</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:601.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">consisted of two layers of canvas with rubber between. After cutting the X, he peeled back the canvas</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:618.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to reveal the rubber layer, used the mirror to scratch up the rubber, squeezed glue onto it, and stuck</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:636.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the patch on. Then he waited for the sun to dry the glue. Sometimes, a whitecap would drench the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:653.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">patch before it dried, and he’d have to begin again.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:670.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">As Louie worked, keeping his eyes on the patches, the sharks kept snapping at him. Growing wiser,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:687.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">they gave up flinging themselves haphazardly at the men and began stalking about, waiting for a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">moment when an oar was down or a back was turned before bulling their way aboard. Over and over</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:722.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">again, they lunged at Louie from behind, where he couldn’t see them. Mac and Phil smacked them</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:2.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">enormous exertion for the diminished men. They found that instead of standing the pump up and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:19.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">pushing the handle downward, it was easier to press the pump handle to their chests and pull the base</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:36.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">toward themselves. All three men were indispensable. Had there been only two, they couldn’t have</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:54.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">pumped, patched, and repelled the sharks. For the first time on the raft, Mac was truly helpful. He</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:71.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was barely strong enough to pull the pump handle a few times in a row, but with the oar he kept every</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:88.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">shark away.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Night fell. In the darkness, patching was impossible, but the pumping couldn’t be stopped. They</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:123.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">pumped all night long, so drained that they lost the feeling in their arms.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:140.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In the morning the patching resumed. The rate of air loss gradually lessened, and they were able to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:157.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">rest for longer periods. Eventually, the air held enough for them to begin brief sleep rotations.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:174.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Once the top was patched, there was the problem of patching the bottom, which was underwater.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:192.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">All three men squeezed onto one side of the raft, balancing on one air tube. They opened up the valve</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:209.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and let the air out of the side they weren’t sitting on, lifted it clear of the water, turned it over so the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:226.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">bottom faced skyward, wiped it off, and held it up to dry. Then Louie began patching. When that half</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:243.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">of the bottom was patched, they reinflated it, crawled onto the repaired side, deflated the other side,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:261.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and repeated the process. Again, whitecaps repeatedly washed over the raft and spoiled the patches,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:278.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and everything had to be redone.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:295.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Finally, they could find no more holes to patch. Because bubbles kept coming up around the sides</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:312.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">of the raft, they knew there were holes someplace where they couldn’t reach. They had to live with</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:330.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">them. The patches had slowed the air loss dramatically. Even when struck by whitecaps, the patches</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:347.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">held. The men found that they could cut back on their pumping to one session every fifteen minutes or</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:364.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">so during the day, and none at night. With the raft now reasonably inflated, the sharks stopped</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">attacking.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:291.01px;top:414.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">——</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:446.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Losing Phil’s raft was a heavy blow. Not only had they lost all of the items stored on it, but now three</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:463.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">men were wedged in a two-man raft, so close together that to move, each man had to ask the others to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:480.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">give him room. There was so little space that they had to take turns straightening their legs. At night,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:498.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">they had to sleep in a bony pile, feet to head.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:515.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">But two good things came from the strafing. Looking at the dead raft, Louie thought of a use for it.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:532.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Using the pliers, he pulled apart the layers of canvas on the ruined raft, creating a large, light sheet. At</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:549.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">last, they had a canopy to block the sun in daytime and the cold at night.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:567.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The other benefit of the strafing was the information it gave the men. When they had a moment to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:584.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">collect themselves, Louie and Phil discussed the Japanese bomber. They thought that it must have</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:601.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">come from the Marshall or Gilbert islands. If they were right in their belief that they were drifting</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:618.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">directly west, then the Marshalls and Gilberts were roughly equidistant from them. They thought that</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:636.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the bomber had probably been on sea search, and if the Japanese followed the same sea search</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:653.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">procedures as the Americans, it would have taken off at around seven </span><span class="cls_003">A.M.</span><span class="cls_004">, a few hours before it had</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:670.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">reached the rafts.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:687.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Estimating the bomber’s cruising speed and range, they made rough calculations to arrive at how</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">many hours the bomber could remain airborne after it left them, and thus how far they were from its</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:722.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">base. They guessed that they were some 850 miles from the bomber’s base. If this was correct, given</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:739.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">that they had crashed about 2,000 miles east of the Marshalls and Gilberts, they had already traveled</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:36.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">guessed the forty-sixth day; Louie guessed the forty-seventh. If their figures were right, they were</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:143.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Two sharks, about eight feet long, were placidly circling the raft. Each time one slid past, Louie</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:160.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">studied its skin. He had banged sharks on the nose many times but had never really felt the hide,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:177.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">which was said to feel like sandpaper. Curious, he dropped a hand into the water and laid it lightly on</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:195.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">a passing shark, feeling its back and dorsal fin as it slid beneath him. It felt rough, just as everyone</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:212.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">said. The shark swished on. The second shark passed, and Louie again let his hand follow its body.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:229.50px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Beautiful</span><span class="cls_004">, he thought.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:246.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Soon after, Louie noticed something odd. Both sharks were gone. Never in four weeks had the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:264.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">sharks left. Louie got up on his knees and leaned out over the water, looking as far down as he could,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:281.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">puzzled. No sharks.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:298.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">He was kneeling there, perched over the edge of the raft, when one of the sharks that he had</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:315.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">touched leapt from the water at terrific speed, mouth wide open, lunging straight at his head. Louie</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:333.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">threw both hands in front of his face. The shark collided with him head-on, trying to get its mouth</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:350.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">around his upper body. Louie, his hands on the animal’s snout, shoved as hard as he could, and the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:367.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">shark splashed back into the water. A moment later, the second shark jumped up. Louie grabbed an</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:384.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">oar and struck the shark in the nose, and it jerked back and slid away. Then the first shark lunged for</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:402.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">him again. Louie was recoiling when he saw an oar swing past, sending the animal backward into the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:419.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">ocean. To Louie’s surprise, it wasn’t Phil who had saved him. It was Mac.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:436.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie had no time to thank him. One of the sharks jumped up again, followed by the other. Louie</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:453.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and Mac sat side by side, clubbing each shark as it lunged at them. Mac was a new man. A moment</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:471.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">before, he had seemed almost comatose. Now he was infused with frantic energy.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:488.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">For several minutes, the sharks took turns bellying onto the raft with gaping mouths, always</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:505.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">launching themselves from the same spot. Finally, they gave up. Louie and Mac collapsed. Phil, who</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:522.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">had been startled awake but had been unable to help because there were only two oars, stared at them</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:540.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">in groggy confusion.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:557.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">“What happened?” he said.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:574.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie looked at Mac with happy amazement and told him how grateful and proud of him he was.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:591.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Mac, crumpled on the bottom of the raft, smiled back. He had pushed himself beyond his body’s</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:609.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">capacities, but the frightened, childlike expression had left his face. Mac had reclaimed himself.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:291.01px;top:641.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">——</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:673.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie was furious at the sharks. He had thought that they had an understanding: The men would stay</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:690.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">out of the sharks’ turf—the water—and the sharks would stay off of theirs—the raft. That the sharks</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:708.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">had taken shots at him when he had gone overboard, and when the raft had been mostly submerged</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:725.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">after the strafing, had seemed fair enough. But their attempt to poach men from their reinflated raft</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:742.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">struck Louie as dirty pool. He stewed all night, scowled hatefully at the sharks all day, and eventually</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:759.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">made a decision. If the sharks were going to try to eat him, he was going to try to eat them.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:2.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">He knelt by the raft wall and watched the sharks, searching for a beatable opponent. One that</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:19.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">looked about five feet long passed. Louie thought he could take it. Louie and Phil made a plan.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:36.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">They had a little bait on the raft, probably the remains of their last bird. Phil hung it on a fishhook</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:54.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and strung it into the water at one end of the raft. At the other end, Louie knelt, facing the water.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:71.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Smelling the bait, the shark swam toward Phil, orienting itself so that its tail was under Louie. Louie</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:88.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">leaned as far overboard as he could without losing his balance, plunged both hands into the water,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and grabbed the tail. The shark took off. Louie, gripping the tail, flew out of the raft and crashed into</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:123.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the water, sending a large serving of the Pacific up his nose. The shark whipped its tail and flung</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:140.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie off. Louie bolted back onto the raft so quickly that he later had no memory of how he had done</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:157.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">it.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:174.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Soaking and embarrassed, Louie rethought his plan. His first error had been one of appraisal:</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:192.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Sharks were stronger than they looked. His second had been to fail to brace himself properly. His</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:209.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">third had been to allow the shark’s tail to stay in the water, giving the animal something to push</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:226.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">against. He settled in to wait for a smaller shark.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:243.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In time, a smaller one, perhaps four feet long, arrived. Louie knelt at the raft’s side, tipping his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:261.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">weight backward and keeping his knees far apart to brace himself. Phil dangled a baited hook in the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:278.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">water.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:295.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The shark swam for the bait. Louie clapped his hands around the tail and heaved it out of the water.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:312.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The shark thrashed, but could neither get free nor pull Louie into the water. Louie dragged the animal</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:330.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">onto the raft. The shark twisted and snapped, and Phil grabbed a flare cartridge and jammed it into the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:347.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">shark’s mouth. Pinning the shark down, Louie took the pliers and stabbed the screwdriver end of the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:364.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">handle through the animal’s eye. The shark died instantly.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:381.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In his Honolulu survival course, Louie had been told that the liver was the only part of a shark that</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was edible. Getting at it was no mean feat. Even with a knife, sharkskin is about as easy to cut as a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:416.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">coat of mail; with only the edge of a mirror to cut with, the labor was draining. After much sawing,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:433.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie managed to break the skin. The flesh underneath stank of ammonia. Louie cut the liver out, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:450.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">it was sizable. They ate it eagerly, giving Mac a larger portion, and for the first time since breakfast</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:468.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">on May 27, they were all full. The rest of the shark reeked, so they threw it overboard. Later, using</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:485.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the same technique, they caught a second shark and again ate the liver.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:502.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Among the sharks, word seemed to get around; no more small sharks came near. Large sharks,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:519.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">some as long as twelve feet, lumbered alongside the raft, but Louie thought better of taking them on.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:537.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The men’s stomachs were soon empty again.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:554.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Mac was in a sharp downward spiral. He rarely moved. All three men had lost a staggering amount</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:571.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">of weight, but Mac had shriveled the most. His eyes, sunken in their sockets, stared out lifelessly.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:291.01px;top:603.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">——</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:636.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">It was nightfall somewhere around the thirtieth day. The men went through their usual routine, bailing</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:653.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">water into the raft and entwining themselves for warmth. The sky was clear and starry, and the moon</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:670.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">shone on the water. The men fell asleep.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:687.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie woke to a tremendous crash, stinging pain, and the sensation of weightlessness. His eyes</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">snapped open and he realized that he, Mac, and Phil were airborne. They flopped down together onto</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:722.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the raft and twisted about in confusion. Something had struck the bottom of the raft with awesome</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:739.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">power. The garden-variety sharks that made up their entourage weren’t large enough to hit them with</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:2.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Looking over the side of the raft, they saw it. Swelling up from under the water came a leviathan: a</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:36.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The animal was some twenty feet long, more than three times the length of the raft. Louie recognized</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:54.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">its features from his survival school training. It was a great white shark.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:88.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">then bent around to the other side, exploring it. Pausing on the surface, it swished its tail away, then</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">slapped it into the raft, sending the raft skidding sideways and splashing a wave of water into the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:140.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The shark began to swim around to the other side. Louie whispered, “</span><span class="cls_002">Don’t make a noise!</span><span class="cls_004">” Again</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:157.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">came the mighty swing, the shower of water, the jolt through the raft and the men.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:174.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Around and around the shark went, drenching the raft with each pass. It seemed to be playing with</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:209.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">under, and the sea smoothed behind it. It did not surface again.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:394.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In subsequent days, Mac became a faint whisper of a man. His water tins ran dry. When Phil</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:429.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">thirst had been the cruelest trial, and he knew that the water left in his tin, essential to his own</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:463.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">sympathetic to Phil, but he couldn’t bring himself to refuse Mac. He gave him a small sip of his own</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:515.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">looked over at Mac, who was watching him. Louie thought it would be disrespectful to lie to Mac,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">precious food stores, and in doing so, he had placed himself and his raftmates in the deepest</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">jeopardy. But in the last days of his life, in the struggle against the deflating raft and the jumping</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:416.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">sharks, he had given all he had left. It wasn’t enough to save him—it had probably hastened his death</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:450.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">survived the crash, Louie and Phil might well have been dead by that thirty-third day. In his dying</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:468.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">days, Mac had redeemed himself.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:485.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In the morning, Phil wrapped Mac’s body in something, probably part of the ruined raft. They knelt</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:502.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">over the body and said aloud all of the good things they knew of Mac, laughing a little at his penchant</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:519.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">for mess hall pie. Louie wanted to give him a religious eulogy but didn’t know how, so he recited</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:537.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">disjointed passages that he remembered from movies, ending with a few words about committing the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:554.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">body to the sea. And he prayed for himself and Phil, vowing that if God would save them, he would</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:571.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">serve heaven forever.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:588.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">When he was done, Louie lifted the shrouded body in his arms. It felt as if it weighed no more than</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:606.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">forty pounds. Louie bent over the side of the raft and gently slid Mac into the water. Mac sank away.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:657.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">know it, they had passed what was almost certainly the record for survival adrift in an inflated raft. If</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:71.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">They held their sun-scorched eyes to the horizon, searching for land, but there was none. Their hunger</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:88.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">dimmed, an ominous sign. They had reached the last stage of starvation.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">One morning, they woke to a strange stillness. The rise and fall of the raft had ceased, and it sat</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:123.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">virtually motionless. There was no wind. The ocean stretched out in all directions in glossy</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:157.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">mariner, Louie and Phil had found the doldrums, the eerie pause of wind and water that lingers around</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:174.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the equator. They were, as Coleridge wrote, “as idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:192.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">It was an experience of transcendence. Phil watched the sky, whispering that it looked like a pearl.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:209.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The water looked so solid that it seemed they could walk across it. When a fish broke the surface far</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:226.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">away, the sound carried to the men with absolute clarity. They watched as pristine ringlets of water</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:243.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">circled outward around the place where the fish had passed, then faded to stillness.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:261.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">For a while they spoke, sharing their wonder. Then they fell into reverent silence. Their suffering</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:278.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was suspended. They weren’t hungry or thirsty. They were unaware of the approach of death.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:295.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">As he watched this beautiful, still world, Louie played with a thought that had come to him before.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:312.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">He had thought it as he had watched hunting seabirds, marveling at their ability to adjust their dives to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:330.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">compensate for the refraction of light in water. He had thought it as he had considered the pleasing</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:347.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">geometry of the sharks, their gradation of color, their slide through the sea. He even recalled the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:364.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">thought coming to him in his youth, when he had lain on the roof of the cabin in the Cahuilla Indian</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Reservation, looking up from Zane Grey to watch night settling over the earth. Such beauty, he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">thought, was too perfect to have come about by mere chance. That day in the center of the Pacific was,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:416.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to him, a gift crafted deliberately, compassionately, for him and Phil.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:433.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Joyful and grateful in the midst of slow dying, the two men bathed in that day until sunset brought it,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:450.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and their time in the doldrums, to an end.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:291.01px;top:483.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">——</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:515.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Given how badly the men’s bodies were faring, it would seem likely that their minds, too, would</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:532.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">begin to fail. But more than five weeks into their ordeal, both Louie and Phil were enjoying</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:549.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">remarkable precision of mind, and were convinced that they were growing sharper every day. They</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:567.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">continued quizzing each other, chasing each other’s stories down to the smallest detail, teaching each</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:584.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">other melodies and lyrics, and cooking imaginary meals.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:601.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie found that the raft offered an unlikely intellectual refuge. He had never recognized how noisy</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:618.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the civilized world was. Here, drifting in almost total silence, with no scents other than the singed</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:636.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">odor of the raft, no flavors on his tongue, nothing moving but the slow procession of shark fins, every</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:670.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">encumbrance that civilization had imposed on it. In his head, he could roam anywhere, and he found</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:687.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">that his mind was quick and clear, his imagination unfettered and supple. He could stay with a thought</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">for hours, turning it about.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:722.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">He had always enjoyed excellent recall, but on the raft, his memory became infinitely more nimble,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:739.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">reaching back further, offering detail that had once escaped him. One day, trying to pinpoint his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:756.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">earliest memory, he saw a two-story building and, inside, a stairway broken into two parts of six</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:138.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">hear singing. He kept listening; it sounded like a choir. He nudged Phil and asked him if he heard</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:155.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">anything. Phil said no. Louie slid the canopy off and squinted into the daylight. The ocean was a</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:426.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">planes. Sometimes they’d see a tiny speck in the sky, sometimes two or more together, making a</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:71.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">began rowing for shore. From overhead came the whine of engines. They looked up and saw Zeros</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:88.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">looping through combat maneuvers, far too high for their pilots to notice the raft below. They rowed</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:174.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">They could see more islands now. Louie spotted a tiny island to their left and pointed it out to Phil,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:330.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">mounted on the boat’s bow. Along the deck stood a line of men, all Japanese. Each one held a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:347.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">weapon, pointed at the castaways.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:364.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">One of the Japanese opened his shirt and pointed to his chest. He seemed to want the Americans to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">do the same. As Louie opened his shirt, he braced himself, expecting to be shot, but no shot came. The</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:450.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and dragged them up, then pulled the raft aboard. On the deck, Louie and Phil attempted to rise, but</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:468.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">their legs buckled. The Japanese were impatient for the men to move across the deck, so the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:485.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Americans crawled on all fours. When they reached the mast, they were picked up and lashed to it.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:502.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Their hands were bound behind their backs.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:519.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">One of the sailors began speaking to them in Japanese. He seemed to be asking questions. Louie</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:537.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and Phil offered responses, trying to guess what the man wanted to know. A soldier waved a bayonet</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:554.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">past Louie’s face, trying to hack off his beard. Another man cracked a pistol across Phil’s jaw, then</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:571.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">moved to do the same to Louie. Louie tipped his head forward in hopes that the sailor would aim for</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:588.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the front of his face; when the sailor swung, Louie jerked his head back. The man missed, but Louie</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:606.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">smacked his head against the mast.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:675.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the biscuit and held it in his mouth, caressing it, feeling the flavor. He ate slowly, savoring each</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:433.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">English, asked how they had ended up there. Louie told the story as the Japanese listened in silent</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:485.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">officers told them. They were on an atoll in the Marshall Islands. They had drifted two thousand</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:537.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">There were forty-eight. The curious servicemen pressed toward the Americans, but the officers kept</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:588.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">military code of honor. Louie described the bomber and the attack. The officers looked at one another</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:606.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and said nothing.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:623.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Two beds were made up, and Louie and Phil were invited to get as much rest as they wished.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:239.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">they were picked up, heaved over men’s shoulders, and carried. Louie felt himself bobbing through</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:273.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Phil, and immediately felt a boot kick into him as a voice shouted, “No!”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">An engine started, and they were moving. They were on the flatbed of a truck. In a few minutes, the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:325.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">steps up, a darkening, the sense that Phil was no longer near him, and the disorienting feeling of being</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:342.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">thrown backward. Louie’s back struck a wall, and he fell to a floor. Someone yanked off his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:360.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">blindfold. A door slammed, a lock turned.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:377.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">At first, Louie could barely see. His eyes darted about uncontrollably. His mind raced, flitting</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:394.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">incoherently from thought to thought. After weeks of endless openness, he was disoriented by the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:411.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">compression of the space around him. Every nerve and muscle seemed in a panic.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:429.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Slowly, his thoughts quieted and his eyes settled. He was in a wooden cell, about the length of a</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:463.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The only window was a hole, about a foot square, in the door. The floor was strewn with gravel, dirt,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:480.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and wiggling maggots, and the room hummed with flies and mosquitoes, already beginning to swarm</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:498.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">onto him. There was a hole in the floor with a latrine bucket below it. The air hung hot and still,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:515.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">oppressive with the stench of human waste.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:532.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie looked up. In the dim light, he saw words carved into the wall: </span><span class="cls_003">NINE MARINES MAROONED ON</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:471.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">up and lay as the guard ordered. He could see that the guard wanted him to lie in this position so he</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:673.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The day passed. Three times, a single wad of rice, a little bigger than a golf ball, sailed through the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:2.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">day, Louie cried out for a doctor. One day, a doctor came. He leaned into the cell, looked at Louie,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:19.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">chuckled, and walked away.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:36.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Curled up on the gravelly floor, both men felt as if their bones were wearing through their skin.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:54.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie begged for a blanket to sit on, but was ignored. He passed the time trying to strengthen his legs,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:71.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">pulling himself upright and standing for a minute or two while holding the wall, then sinking down.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:88.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">He missed the raft.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Two sips of water a day weren’t nearly enough to replace Louie’s torrential fluid loss. His thirst</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:123.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">became worse than anything he’d known on the raft. He crawled to the door and pleaded for water.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:140.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The guard left, then returned with a cup. Louie, grateful, drew close to the door to take a drink. The</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:157.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">guard threw scalding water in his face. Louie was so dehydrated that he couldn’t help but keep</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:174.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">begging. At least four more times, the response was the same, leaving Louie’s face speckled with</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:192.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">blisters. Louie knew that dehydration might kill him, and part of him hoped it would.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:209.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">One day, as he lay in misery, Louie heard singing. The voices he had heard over the raft had come</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:226.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to him again. He looked around his cell, but the singers weren’t there. Only their music was with him.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:243.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">He let it wash over him, finding in it a reason to hope. Eventually, the song faded away, but silently,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:261.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">in his mind, Louie sang it over and over to himself. He prayed intensely, ardently, hour after hour.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:278.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Down the hall, Phil languished. Rats were everywhere, climbing up his waste bucket and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:295.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">wallowing in his urine pail, waking him at night by skittering over his face. Periodically, he was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:312.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">prodded outside, halted before a pan of water, and ordered to wash his face and hands. Phil dropped</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:330.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">his face into the pan and slurped up the water.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:347.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie often stared at the names of the marines, wondering who they were, if they’d had wives and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:364.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">children, how the end had come for them. He began to think of them as his friends. One day he pulled</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">off his belt and bent the buckle upward. In tall, block letters, he carved his name into the wall beside</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">theirs.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:416.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie couldn’t speak to Phil, nor Phil to him, but occasionally one of them would cough or scuff the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:433.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">floor to let the other know that he was there. Once, the guards left the cells unattended, and for the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:450.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">first time, Phil and Louie were alone. Louie heard Phil’s voice.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:468.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">“What’s going to happen?”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:485.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie had no answer. There was a beating of boots in the hall and the Americans fell silent.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:291.01px;top:517.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">——</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:549.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The guards maintained a fixed state of fury at the captives, glaring at them wrathfully, making</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:567.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">threatening gestures, shouting at them. Virtually every day, they flew into rages that usually ended in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:584.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Phil and Louie being bombarded with stones and lit cigarettes, spat upon, and poked with sticks.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:601.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie always knew that he was in for it when he heard a guard arriving in a stomping fit—a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:618.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">consequence, he hoped, of an American victory. The situation worsened when the guard had</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:636.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">company; the guards used the captives to impress each other with their cruelty.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:653.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The pretext for many of the outbursts was miscommunication. The captives and their guards came</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:670.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">from cultures with virtually no overlap in language or custom. Louie and Phil found it almost</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:687.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">impossible to understand what was being asked of them. Sign language was of little help, because</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">even the cultures’ gestures were different. The guards, like nearly all citizens of their historically</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:722.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">isolated nation, had probably never seen a foreigner before, and probably had no experience in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:739.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">communicating with a non-Japanese. When misunderstood, they often became so exasperated that they</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:756.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">screamed at and beat the captives.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:2.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">For self-preservation, Louie and Phil studied everything they heard, developing small Japanese</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:19.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">vocabularies. </span><span class="cls_002">Kocchi koi</span><span class="cls_004"> meant “come here.” </span><span class="cls_002">Ohio</span><span class="cls_004"> was a greeting, used by the occasional civil</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:36.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">guard. Though Louie soon knew what it meant, his stock reply was “No, California.” Phil learned that</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:54.00px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">mizu</span><span class="cls_004"> meant water, but the knowledge got him nowhere; his cries for </span><span class="cls_002">mizu</span><span class="cls_004"> were ignored.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:71.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">When the guards weren’t venting their fury at the captives, they entertained themselves by</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:88.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">humiliating them. Every day, at gunpoint, Louie was forced to stand up and dance, staggering through</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the Charleston while his guards roared with laughter. The guards made Louie whistle and sing, pelted</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:123.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">him with fistfuls of gravel, taunted him as he crawled around his cell to pick up bits of rice, and slid</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:140.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">long sticks through the door window so they could stab and swat him, finding his helpless contortions</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:157.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">hilarious. Down the hall, the guards did the same to Phil. Sometimes Louie could hear Phil’s voice,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:174.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">tiny and thin, groaning. Once, driven to his breaking point by a guard jabbing him, Louie yanked the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:192.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">stick from the guard’s hands. He knew he might get killed for it, but under this unceasing degradation,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:209.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">something was happening to him. His will to live, resilient through all of the trials on the raft, was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:226.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">beginning to fray.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:243.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The crash of </span><span class="cls_002">Green Hornet</span><span class="cls_004"> had left Louie and Phil in the most desperate physical extremity,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:261.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">without food, water, or shelter. But on Kwajalein, the guards sought to deprive them of something that</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:278.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">had sustained them even as all else had been lost: dignity. This self-respect and sense of self-worth,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:295.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the innermost armament of the soul, lies at the heart of humanness; to be deprived of it is to be</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:312.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">dehumanized, to be cleaved from, and cast below, mankind. Men subjected to dehumanizing treatment</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:330.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">experience profound wretchedness and loneliness and find that hope is almost impossible to retain.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:347.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Without dignity, identity is erased. In its absence, men are defined not by themselves, but by their</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:364.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">captors and the circumstances in which they are forced to live. One American airman, shot down and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">relentlessly debased by his Japanese captors, described the state of mind that his captivity created: “I</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was literally becoming a lesser human being.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:416.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Few societies treasured dignity, and feared humiliation, as did the Japanese, for whom a loss of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:433.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">honor could merit suicide. This is likely one of the reasons why Japanese soldiers in World War II</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:450.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">debased their prisoners with such zeal, seeking to take from them that which was most painful and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:468.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">destructive to lose. On Kwajalein, Louie and Phil learned a dark truth known to the doomed in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:485.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Hitler’s death camps, the slaves of the American South, and a hundred other generations of betrayed</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:502.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">people. Dignity is as essential to human life as water, food, and oxygen. The stubborn retention of it,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:519.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">even in the face of extreme physical hardship, can hold a man’s soul in his body long past the point at</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:537.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">which the body should have surrendered it. The loss of it can carry a man off as surely as thirst,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:554.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">hunger, exposure, and asphyxiation, and with greater cruelty. In places like Kwajalein, degradation</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:571.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">could be as lethal as a bullet.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:636.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie had been on Kwajalein for about a week when his cell door was thrown open and two guards</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:653.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">pulled him out. He flushed with fear, thinking that he was being taken to the sword. As he was hustled</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:670.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">toward what seemed to be an officers’ quarters, he passed two girls with Asian features, walking</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:71.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The Japanese military, he said, provides women for its soldiers, an allusion to the thousands of</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:226.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">him.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:243.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">What did he know about the E-model B-24? Nothing, he told them. It was a lie; </span><span class="cls_002">Super Man</span><span class="cls_004">, while</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:261.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">always officially a D model, had undergone upgrades that had effectively made it an E. Where was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:278.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the radar system? The location of the radar had no bearing on how it worked, so Louie told the truth.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:295.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">How do you operate it? Louie knew the answer, but he replied that as a bombardier, he wouldn’t</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:312.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">know. The interrogators asked him to draw the radar system. Louie invented an imaginary system,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:330.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">making a drawing so elaborate that, it was later written, the system looked like “a ruptured octopus.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:347.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The interrogators nodded.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:364.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">They moved on to the Norden bombsight. How do you work it? You just twist two knobs, Louie</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">said. The officers were annoyed. Louie was sent back to his cell.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Suspecting that he’d be brought back, Louie brainstormed, trying to anticipate questions. He thought</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:416.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">about which things he could divulge and which things he couldn’t. For the latter, he came up with lies</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:433.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and practiced until he could utter them smoothly. Because he’d been partially truthful in the first</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:450.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">session, he was now in a better position to lie.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:468.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Phil was pulled in for interrogation. He, too, knew about the captured B-24D, so he spoke freely</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:485.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">about the plane’s components. The interrogators asked him to describe American war strategy. He</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:502.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">replied that he thought they would attack the outlying captured territories, then work their way in until</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:519.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">they defeated Japan. The interrogators responded with whoops of laughter. Phil sensed something</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:537.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">forced. These men, he suspected, thought that Japan was going to lose.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:601.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie was sitting in his cell when a new guard appeared at the door. Louie looked up, saw a face he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:618.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">didn’t recognize, and felt an upswell of dread, knowing that a new guard would likely assert his</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:653.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">“You Christian?” the guard asked.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:670.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie, whose parents had tried to raise him Catholic, hadn’t gone near church since one Sunday in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:687.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">his boyhood, when a priest had punished him for tardiness by grabbing him by the ear and dragging</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">him out. But though Louie emerged with a sore ear, a little religion had stuck with him. He said yes.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:722.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The guard smiled.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:739.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">“Me Christian.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:756.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The guard gave his name, which Louie would later recall, with some uncertainty, as Kawamura. He</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:19.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">missionaries and conversion. The guard slipped two pieces of hard candy into Louie’s hand, then</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:36.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">moved down the hall and gave two pieces to Phil. A friendship was born.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:54.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Kawamura brought a pencil and paper and began making drawings to illustrate things he wished to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:71.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">talk about. Walking back and forth between the cells, he’d draw a picture of something—a car, a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:88.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">plane, an ice cream cone—and say and write its Japanese name. Louie and Phil would then write and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">say the English name. The prisoners understood almost nothing of what Kawamura said, but his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:123.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">goodwill needed no translation. Kawamura could do nothing to improve the physical conditions in</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:157.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">When Kawamura was off guard duty, a new guard came. He launched himself at Louie, ramming a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:174.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">stick through the door window and into Louie’s face, as if trying to put out his eyes. The next day,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:192.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Kawamura saw Louie’s bloody face and asked who had done it. Upon hearing the guard’s name,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:209.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Kawamura hardened, lifting his arm and flexing his biceps at Louie. When his shift was up, he sped</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:243.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">For two days, Louie saw nothing of Kawamura or the vicious guard. Then Kawamura returned,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:261.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">opened Louie’s cell door a crack, and proudly pointed out the guard who had beaten Louie. His</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:278.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">forehead and mouth were heavily bandaged. He never guarded the cell again.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:342.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">As Louie and Phil lay in their cells one day, they heard a commotion outside, the clamoring sounds of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:360.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">a mob. Then faces pressed into Louie’s door window, shouting. Rocks started flying in. More men</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:377.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">came, one after another, screaming, spitting on Louie, hitting him with rocks, hurling sticks like</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:394.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">javelins. Down the hall, the men were doing the same to Phil. Louie balled himself up at the far end of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:411.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the cell.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:429.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">On and on the procession went. There were eighty, perhaps ninety men, and each one spent some</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:446.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">thirty seconds attacking each captive. At last, the men left. Louie sat in pools of spit and jumbled</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:463.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">rocks and sticks, bleeding.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:480.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">When Kawamura saw what had happened, he was livid. He explained that the attackers were a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:498.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">submarine crew stopping over on the island. When Louie was taken to interrogation, he complained</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:515.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">about the attack. The officers replied that this was what he ought to expect.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:532.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The interrogators wanted Louie to tell them the numbers of aircraft, ships, and personnel in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:549.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Hawaii. Louie told them that the last time he’d seen Hawaii, it had been May. Now it was August. He</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:567.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">couldn’t be expected to have current information. He was sent back to his cell.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:631.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Some three weeks after his arrival on Kwajalein, Louie was again pulled from his cell. Outside for</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:648.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the first time since his arrival on the island, he saw Phil. Their eyes met. It looked like this might be</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:683.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">They were taken to the interrogation building, but this time they were halted on the front porch, Phil</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:700.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">on one end, Louie on the other. Two men in white medical coats joined them, along with four aides</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:717.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">holding paperwork and stopwatches. Japanese began collecting below the porch to watch.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:735.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie and Phil were ordered to lie down. The doctors pulled out two long hypodermic syringes</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:19.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">would be good for the prisoners. If the solution worked as hoped—improving their condition, they</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:36.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">were told—it would be given to Japanese troops.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:54.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The doctors turned the captives’ hands palm-up and swabbed their arms with alcohol. The needles</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:71.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">slid in, the plungers depressed, and the aides clicked the stopwatches. The doctors told the captives</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:88.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to describe their sensations.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">For Louie, within a few seconds, the porch started gyrating. The doctor pushed more solution into</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:140.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">blood rushed from his head, the same sensation that he used to feel when Phil lifted </span><span class="cls_002">Super Man</span><span class="cls_004"> out of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:157.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">a dive. His skin burned, itched, and stung. The porch pitched and turned. Across the porch, Phil was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:174.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">experiencing the same symptoms. The doctors, speaking in sterile tones, continued to question them.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:192.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Then everything blurred. Louie cried out that he was going to faint. The doctor withdrew the needle.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:209.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The captives were taken back to their cells. Within fifteen minutes, Louie’s entire body was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:226.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">covered in a rash. He lay awake all night, itching and burning. Several days later, when the symptoms</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:243.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">subsided, he and Phil were again taken to the porch and again injected, this time with more solution.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:261.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Again they rolled through vertigo and burned with rashes. After another few days, they were</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:278.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">subjected to a third experiment, and a few days later came a fourth. In the last infusion, a full pint of</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:446.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">picked out a familiar word: dengue. The prisoners had dengue fever, a potentially fatal mosquito-</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:463.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">borne illness that was ravaging the tropics. The doctor offered no treatment.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:532.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie floated through it, too sick to resist. The faces streamed past, and the stones and sticks</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:549.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">cracked off his burning bones. Time passed with merciful speed, and the abuse was soon over.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:631.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">alleged spying, and was stunned to see his friend in the service of his enemy. Sasaki looked at him</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:648.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">warmly. He’d been prepared to see Louie, but he was disturbed by how thin he was. He made a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:666.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">playful crack about how ugly Louie looked bald.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:683.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">What followed was a strange and stilted conversation. Sasaki asked a few questions about Louie’s</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:735.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was to express confidence that Japan would win the war. He told Louie that he was a civilian</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie was led to a bench, some distance from the other captives. He saw Phil far away, sitting</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:123.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">alone. A couple of captives sat on other benches across the compound, hiding their hands from the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:174.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">began to tell Louie about where he was.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:192.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">This wasn’t a POW camp. It was a secret interrogation center called Ofuna, where “high-value”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:209.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">captured men were housed in solitary confinement, starved, tormented, and tortured to divulge</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:226.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">military secrets. Because Ofuna was kept secret from the outside world, the Japanese operated with</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:243.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">an absolutely free hand. The men in Ofuna, said the Japanese, weren’t POWs; they were “unarmed</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:261.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">combatants” at war against Japan and, as such, didn’t have the rights that international law accorded</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:278.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">POWs. In fact, they had no rights at all. If captives “confessed their crimes against Japan,” they’d be</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:295.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">treated “as well as regulations permit.” Over the course of the war, some one thousand Allied</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:312.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">captives would be hauled into Ofuna, and many would be held there for years.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:515.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">for guard duty were the dregs of the Japanese military. Many had washed out of regular soldierly life,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:532.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">too incompetent to perform basic duties. Quite a few were deranged. According to captives, there</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:567.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was murderous sadism.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:584.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In the Japanese military of that era, corporal punishment was routine practice. “Iron must be beaten</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:601.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">while it’s hot; soldiers must be beaten while they’re fresh” was a saying among servicemen. “No</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:618.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">strong soldiers,” went another, “are made without beatings.” For all Japanese soldiers, especially</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:636.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">low-ranking ones, beating was inescapable, often a daily event. It is thus unsurprising that camp</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:653.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">guards, occupying the lowest station in a military that applauded brutality, would vent their</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">This tendency was powerfully reinforced by two opinions common in Japanese society in that era.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:36.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">served as an accelerant for abuse of Allied prisoners.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:54.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In Japan’s militaristic society, all citizens, from earliest childhood, were relentlessly indoctrinated</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:71.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">with the lesson that to be captured in war was intolerably shameful. The 1941 Japanese Military</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:88.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Field Code made clear what was expected of those facing capture: “Have regard for your family first.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:123.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">dishonorable name.” As a result, in many hopeless battles, virtually every Japanese soldier fought to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:140.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the death. For every Allied soldier killed, four were captured; for every 120 Japanese soldiers killed,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:157.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">one was captured. In some losing battles, Japanese soldiers committed suicide en masse to avoid</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:174.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">capture. The few who were captured sometimes gave false names, believing that their families would</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:192.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">rather think that their son had died. The depth of the conviction was demonstrated at Australia’s</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:243.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">suicides.” The contempt and revulsion that most Japanese felt for those who surrendered or were</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:261.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">captured extended to Allied servicemen. This thinking created an atmosphere in which to abuse,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:295.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Some guards, intoxicated by absolute power and indoctrinated in racism and disgust for POWs, fell</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:312.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">easily into sadism. But those less inclined toward their culture’s prejudices may still have been</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:330.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">vulnerable to the call to brutality. To be made responsible for imprisoning people is surely, to many</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:364.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">most basic necessities. Perhaps some guards forced their prisoners to live in maximally dehumanizing</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">conditions so that they could reassure themselves that they were merely giving loathsome beasts their</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">due. Paradoxically, then, some of the worst abuses inflicted on captives and POWs may have arisen</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:416.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">from the guards’ discomfort with being abusive.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:36.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">handling Ofuna well enough, but he remained shrunken and frail, a hollow distance in his eyes. During</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:222.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">captives were illusions. Beneath the hush was a humming underground of defiance.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:239.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">It began with sidelong whispers. The guards couldn’t be everywhere, and as soon as an area was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:256.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">left unattended, the captives became absorbed in stealthy muttering. Men scribbled notes on slips of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:273.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">toilet paper and hid them for each other in the </span><span class="cls_002">benjo</span><span class="cls_004">. Once, when given permission to speak aloud so</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">he could translate orders, Commander Maher advised another captive on stealing techniques, right in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:308.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">front of the oblivious guards. The boldest captives would walk up to the guards, look straight at them,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:325.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and speak in English, using a querying tone. The confused guards thought they were being asked</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:342.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">questions, when in fact the men were speaking to each other.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:360.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">When words couldn’t be used, Morse code could. At night, in the small intervals when the guards</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:377.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">left the building, the whole barracks would start tapping. Outside, men would whisper in code, using</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:429.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">would be remembered for descriptions of his mother’s cooking—but the content didn’t matter. The</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:446.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">triumph was in the subversion.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:463.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie soon learned a critical rule of conversation: Never use a guard’s real name. Guards who</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:480.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">discovered that they were being discussed often delivered savage beatings, so the men invented</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:498.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">nicknames for them. The sluggish, quiet camp commander was called the Mummy. Guard nicknames</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:515.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">included Turdbird, Flange Face, the Weasel, Liver Lip, Fatty, and Termite. A particularly repugnant</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:549.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The defiance took on a life of its own. Men would smile and address the guards in friendly tones,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:567.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">cooing out insults filthy enough to curl a man’s hair. One captive convinced a particularly dim-witted</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:653.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie had another, private act of rebellion. A fellow captive, a bookbinder in civilian life, gave</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Allied losses and ridiculously implausible Japanese feats. Once, they announced that their military</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:192.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">picked clean, the news tapping its way down the cell blocks in minutes. Newspapers rarely appeared,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:209.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">but when one did, stealing it became a campwide obsession. Rations were sometimes delivered to</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:261.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">being questioned. Once stolen, the papers made elaborate secret journeys, passed hand to hand until</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:312.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the papers vanished, soon to be put to their final use. In a camp with a lot of dysentery and little toilet</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:554.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">“antiaircraft gun,” and “captive.” In creating the dictionary, Harris may have had more in mind than</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:396.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">resumed the habit. Men became fiercely addicted. The few who didn’t smoke still received the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:431.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Anton Minsaas, became so hooked that he began trading his food for smokes. Louie urged him to eat,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:638.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The guards were fascinated to learn that the sick, emaciated man in the first barracks had once been</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:586.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">dangling ankle. Then Garrett was flown to another island and thrown into a cell block where nineteen</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:446.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was about a mile and a half, in laps around the compound. Louie had no intention of winning, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:463.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">lagged behind for most of it. But as he ran, he found that his body was so light that carrying it was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:480.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">surprisingly easy. All around the compound, the captives watched him, breathless. As the finish</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:549.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">months of humiliation brought something in him to a hard point. He lengthened his stride, seized the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:432.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">word came. But the family’s conviction remained unshaken. To the family, Louie was among them</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:535.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">On July 13, Louise felt a wave of urgency. She penned a letter to Major General Willis Hale,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:552.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">commander of the Seventh Air Force. In it, she begged Hale not to give up searching; Louie, she</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:570.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">wrote, was alive. Unbeknownst to Louise, on that same day, Louie was captured.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:587.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Several weeks later, a reply came from Hale’s office. The letter said that given the failure of the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:276.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">They’d been driven to this point by a long, desperate spring and summer. Every day, the men were</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:294.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">slapped, kicked, beaten, humiliated, and driven through forced exercises. There were sudden</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:311.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">explosions of violence that left captives spilled over the ground, hoping they wouldn’t be killed. And</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:328.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">that spring, the central authorities had cut rations to all prisoners dramatically. With only about half of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:345.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the official ration ending up in the captives’ bowls, the men were wasting away. When the Japanese</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:363.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">weighed the captives, Bill Harris, over six feet tall, tipped the scale at 120 pounds. He had</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:380.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">developed beriberi.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:397.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie was driven to ever more reckless efforts to find food. He stole an onion and secretly cooked</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:414.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">it under a water heater, but divided between several men, it didn’t amount to much. He stole a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:432.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">package of miso paste and, when the guards weren’t looking, shoveled it into his mouth and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:449.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">swallowed it in one gulp, not knowing that miso paste is extremely concentrated, meant to be diluted</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:466.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">in water. He was soon doubled over behind the barracks, heaving his guts out. He was so mad for</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:483.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">food that he snuck from his cell late at night, broke into the kitchen, and crammed his mouth full of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:501.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">chestnuts that were to be served to the guards. When he looked up, Shithead was there, watching him.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:518.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie backed away, then sprinted back to his cell. Shithead didn’t beat him for it, but the guard’s</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:535.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">appearance was enough to scare Louie out of another go at the kitchen. The best he could do was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:552.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">volunteer to starch the guards’ shirts. The starch was made from rice water pressed through cloth;</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:570.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">after Louie pressed the rice, he spent the rest of his time picking flecks of it off the cloth and eating</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:604.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Finally, opportunity knocked. Camp officials asked for a volunteer to work as barber for the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:639.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">intimidating, but Louie had to eat. When he came forward, he was given not just electric clippers but</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:656.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">a straight razor. He’d never used one before, and he knew what the guards would do to him if they</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:673.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">were nicked. He took the razor to his cell and practiced on himself until he could shave without</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:690.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">drawing blood. When he walked out to do his first job, the guard balled up his fist at him, then made a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:708.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">demand that, to an American, seemed bizarre. He wanted his forehead shaved, a standard barbering</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:725.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">practice in Japan. All of the guards expected Louie to do this. Louie managed not to cut anyone, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:742.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the rice balls kept him alive.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:88.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie backed away, waiting for the Weasel to burst out. Several other guards went into the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:187.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">For the captives, every day was lived with the knowledge that it could be their last. The nearer the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:204.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Allies came to Japan, the larger loomed the threat of the kill-all order. The captives had only a vague</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:222.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">idea of how the war was going, but the Japanese were clearly worried. In an interrogation session in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:239.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">late spring, an official told Fitzgerald that if Japan lost, the captives would be executed. “Hope for</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:256.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Japan’s victory,” he said. The quest for news of the war took on special urgency.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:273.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">One morning, Louie was on the parade ground, under orders to sweep the compound. He saw the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Mummy—the camp commander—sitting under a cherry tree, holding a newspaper. He was nodding</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:308.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">off. Louie loitered near him, watching. The Mummy’s head tipped, his fingers parted, and the paper</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:325.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">fluttered to the ground. Louie swept his way over, reached out with the broom, and, as quietly as he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:342.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">could, forked the newspaper to himself. The text was in Japanese, but there was a war map on one</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:360.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">page. Louie ran to the barracks, found Harris, and held the paper up before him. Harris stared at it,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:377.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">memorizing the map. Louie then ran the paper to the garbage so they’d have no evidence of the theft.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:394.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Harris drew a perfect rendering of the map, showed it to the other captives, then destroyed it. The</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:411.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">map confirmed that the Allies were closing in on Japan.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:446.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">in the Mariana Islands, south of mainland Japan. A spindly new captive was hauled in, and everyone</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:463.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">eyed him as a source of information, but the guards kept him isolated and forbade the veterans from</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:480.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">speaking to him. When the new man was led to the bathhouse, Louie saw his chance. He snuck behind</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:498.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the building and looked in an open window. The captive was standing naked, holding a pan of water</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:515.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and washing as the guard stood by. Then the guard stepped away to light a cigarette.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:532.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">“If we’ve taken Saipan, drop the pan,” Louie whispered.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:549.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The pan clattered to the floor. The captive picked it up, dropped it again, then did it a third time.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:618.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">make the three-thousand-mile round-trip between Saipan and Japan’s home islands, the captives must</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:636.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">have believed that winning Saipan was only a preliminary step to establishing an island base within</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:670.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">with tremendous range. From Saipan, the Japanese mainland was already within reach.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:687.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The guards and officials were increasingly agitated. Sasaki had long crowed about the inevitability</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:239.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">were covered in leeches. Louie had six on his chest alone. The men became frantic, begging the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:256.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">guards for their cigarettes. As they squirmed around, jabbing at the leeches with cigarettes, one of the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:446.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The beatings went on. The Quack was especially feral. One day, Louie saw some Japanese</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:463.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">dumping fish into the trough in which the captives washed their hands and feet. Told to wash the fish,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:480.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie walked up and peered into the trough. The fish were putrid and undulating with maggots. As he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:498.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">recoiled, the Quack saw him, pounded over, and punched him a dozen times. That night, the same fish</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:515.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was ladled into Louie’s bowl. Louie wouldn’t touch it. A guard jabbed him behind the ear with a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:532.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">bayonet and forced him to eat it.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:549.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">And then there was Gaga. Something about this affectionate little duck, perhaps the fact that he was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:567.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">beloved to the captives, provoked the guards. They tortured him mercilessly, kicking him and hurling</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:584.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">him around. Then one day, in full view of the captives, Shithead opened his pants and violated the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:601.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">bird. Gaga died. Of all the things he witnessed in war, Louie would say, this was the worst.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:618.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie’s mind fled Ofuna and carried him home. He hadn’t seen his family in two years. He thought</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:636.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">of the little white house, Virginia and Sylvia, his father and dear, devoted Pete. Most poignant were</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:653.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">his memories of his mother. Fred Garrett had told Louie that he’d been given up for dead. Louie</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:670.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">couldn’t bear the thought of what this news must have done to his mother.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:687.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">It was the accumulation of so much suffering, the tug of memory, and the conviction that the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Japanese wouldn’t let them leave Ofuna alive that led Louie to listen to the nearby planes and wonder</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:722.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">if they could be a way out. Examining the fence, he, Tinker, and Harris concluded that it might be</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:739.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">possible to get around the guards and over the barbed wire. The thought hooked all three of them.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:756.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">They decided to make a run for it, commandeer a plane, and get out of Japan.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:34.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">At first, their plans hit a dead end. They’d been brought in blindfolded and had ventured out of camp</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:51.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">only briefly, to irrigate the rice paddies, so they knew little about the area. They didn’t know where</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:69.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the airport was, or how they’d steal a plane. Then a kind guard inadvertently helped them. Thinking</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:86.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">that they might enjoy looking at a book, he gave them a Japanese almanac. Harris cracked it open and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:103.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was immediately rapt. The book was full of detailed information on Japan’s ports, the ships in its</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:120.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">harbors and the fuels they used, and the distances between cities and landmarks. It was everything</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:138.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">they needed to craft an escape.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:155.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In hours spent poring over the book, they shaped a plan. They discarded the plane idea in favor of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:172.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">escape by boat. Just a few miles to the east was the port of Yokohama, only there was nowhere to go</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:189.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">from there. But if they crossed Japan to the western shore, they could get to a port that would offer a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:207.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">good route to safety.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:224.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">They’d go on foot. Harris plotted a path across the island, a walk of about 150 miles. It would be</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:241.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">dangerous, but Harris’s earlier experience of hiking all over the Bataan Peninsula gave them</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:258.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">confidence. Once at a port, they’d steal a powerboat and fuel, cross the Sea of Japan, and flee into</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:276.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">China. Given that Louie had drifted two thousand miles on a hole-riddled raft with virtually no</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:293.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">provisions, a few hundred miles on the Sea of Japan in a sturdy powered boat seemed manageable.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:310.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Tinker, who’d been captured more recently than Harris and Louie, had the most current knowledge of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:327.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">which areas of China were occupied by the enemy. He worked out a route that they hoped would steer</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:345.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">them clear of the Japanese.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:362.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">They counted on finding safe harbor in China. In 1942, America had launched its first and, until</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:396.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">an aircraft carrier, under command of Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle. After bombing Japan,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:414.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">some of the Doolittle crews had run out of gas and crashed or bailed out over China. Civilians had</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:431.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">hidden the airmen from the Japanese, who’d ransacked the country in search of them. Harris, Tinker,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:448.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and Louie had heard rumors that the Japanese had retaliated against Chinese civilians for sheltering</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:465.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the Doolittle men, but didn’t know the true extent of it. The Japanese had murdered an estimated</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:483.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">quarter of a million civilians.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:500.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">There was one problem that the men didn’t know how to overcome. When they stood near the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:517.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">guards, it was impossible not to notice how much the Americans differed from typical Japanese</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:534.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">people, and not simply in facial features. The average Japanese soldier was five foot three. Louie</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:552.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was five foot ten, Tinker six feet, Harris even taller. Hiking across Japan, they’d be extremely</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:569.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">conspicuous. China might be welcoming, but in Japan, it would be foolish to assume that they’d find</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:586.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">friendly civilians. After the war, some POWs would tell of heroic Japanese civilians who snuck them</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:603.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">food and medicine, incurring ferocious beatings from guards when they were caught. But this</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:621.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">behavior was not the rule. POWs led through cities were often swarmed by civilians, who beat them,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:638.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">struck them with rocks, and spat on them. If Louie, Harris, and Tinker were caught, they would almost</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:655.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">certainly be killed, either by civilians or by the authorities. Unable to remedy the height difference,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:672.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">they decided to move only at night and hope for the best. If they were going to die in Japan, at least</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:690.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">they could take a path that they and not their captors chose, declaring, in this last act of life, that they</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:707.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">remained sovereign over their own souls.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:724.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">As the plan took shape, the prospective escapees walked as much as possible, strengthening their</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:741.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">legs. They studied the guards’ shifts, noting that there was a patch of time at night when only one</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:88.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Just before the getaway date, an event occurred that changed everything. At one of the POW camps,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">a prisoner escaped. Ofuna officials assembled the men and issued a new decree: Anyone caught</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:123.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">escaping would be executed, and for every escapee, several captive officers would be shot. Louie,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:204.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">With the escape off, Louie and Harris channeled their energy into the captive information network. At</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:239.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">map printed in it. Few things were more dangerous than stealing from the Quack, but given the threat</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:256.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">of mass executions upon an Allied invasion, the captives were willing to do almost anything to get</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:411.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">newspaper was still there, sitting on the desk. Louie snatched the paper, stuck it under his shirt, then</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:429.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">crawled back out, rose to his feet, and walked to Harris’s cell, striding as quickly as he could without</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:446.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">attracting attention. He opened the paper and showed it to Harris, who stared at it for several</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:463.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">seconds. Then Louie crammed it under his shirt again and sped back to the Quack’s office. His luck</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:480.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">had held; the Quack and the guards were still outside. He went back down on all fours, hurried in,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:498.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">threw the paper on the desk, and fled. No one had seen him.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:515.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">At the barracks, Harris pulled out a strip of toilet paper and a pencil and drew the map. The men</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:532.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">all looked at it. Memories later differed as to the subject of the map, but everyone recalled that it</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:549.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">showed Allied progress. Harris hid the map among his belongings.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:567.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In the late afternoon of September 9, Harris was sitting in a cell with another captive, discussing</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:584.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the war, when the Quack swept into the doorway. Harris hadn’t heard him coming. The Quack noticed</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:601.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">something in Harris’s hand, stepped in, and snatched it. It was the map.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:618.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The Quack studied the map; on it, he saw the words “Philippine” and “Taiwan.” He demanded that</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:636.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Harris tell him what it was; Harris replied that it was idle scribbling. The Quack wasn’t fooled. He</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:653.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">went to Harris’s cell, ransacked it, and found, by his account, a trove of hand-drawn maps—some</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:670.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">showing air defenses of mainland Japan—as well as the stolen newspaper clipping and the dictionary</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:687.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">of military terms. The Quack called in an officer, who spoke to Harris, then left. Everyone thought</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">that the issue was resolved.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:722.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">That night, the Quack abruptly called all captives into the compound. He looked strange, his face</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:739.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">crimson. He ordered the men to do push-ups for about twenty minutes, then adopt the Ofuna crouch.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:756.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Then he told Harris to step forward. Louie heard the marine whisper, “Oh my God. My map.”</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:308.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">“What the hell is going on?” He demanded to know where they’d gotten matches. Louie explained</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:325.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">how he had built the fire. The corporal’s face clouded over. Without warning, the corporal slugged</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:377.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">expression neutral, as the second swing connected with his head. The corporal ordered them to put</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:495.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">children of Shizuka Watanabe, a lovely and exceptionally wealthy woman. The Watanabes enjoyed a</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:582.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">His siblings knew him affectionately as Mu-cchan.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:616.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">studied French literature and cultivated an infatuation with nihilism. In 1942, he graduated, settled in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:633.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Tokyo, and took a job at a news agency. He worked there for only one month; Japan was at war, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:651.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Mutsuhiro was deeply patriotic. He enlisted in the army.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:668.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Watanabe had lofty expectations for himself as a soldier. One of his older brothers was an officer,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:685.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and his older sister’s husband was commander of Changi, a giant POW camp in Singapore. Attaining</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:702.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">an officer’s rank was of supreme importance to Watanabe, and when he applied to become an officer,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:720.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">he probably thought that acceptance was his due, given his education and pedigree. But he was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:737.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">rejected; he would be only a corporal. By all accounts, this was the moment that derailed him, leaving</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:19.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">informed by it. This defining event would have tragic consequences for hundreds of men.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:36.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Corporal Watanabe was sent to a regiment of the Imperial Guards in Tokyo, stationed near</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:88.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">for NCOs, a POW camp. Perhaps his superiors wanted to rid the Imperial Guards of an unstable and</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:123.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Omori and designated the “disciplinary officer.” On the last day of November 1943, Watanabe</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:140.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">arrived.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:291.01px;top:172.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">——</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:204.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Even prior to Watanabe’s appearance, Omori had been a trying place. The 1929 Geneva Convention,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:222.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">which Japan had signed but never ratified, permitted detaining powers to use POWs for labor, with</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:239.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">restrictions. The laborers had to be physically fit, and the labor couldn’t be dangerous, unhealthy, or</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:256.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">of unreasonable difficulty. The work had to be unconnected to the operations of war, and POWs were</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:273.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to be given pay commensurate with their labor. Finally, to ensure that POW officers had control over</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">their men, they could not be forced to work.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:308.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Virtually nothing about Japan’s use of POWs was in keeping with the Geneva Convention. To be an</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:325.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">enlisted prisoner of war under the Japanese was to be a slave. The Japanese government made</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:342.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">contracts with private companies to send enlisted POWs to factories, mines, docks, and railways,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:360.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">where the men were forced into exceptionally arduous war-production or war-transport labor. The</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:377.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">labor, performed under club-wielding foremen, was so dangerous and exhausting that thousands of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:394.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">POWs died on the job. In the extremely rare instances in which the Japanese compensated the POWs</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:411.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">for their work, payment amounted to almost nothing, equivalent to a few pennies a week. The only</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:429.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">aspect of the Geneva Convention that the Japanese sometimes respected was the prohibition on</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:446.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">forcing officers to work.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:463.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Like almost every other camp, Omori was a slave camp. For ten to eleven hours a day, seven days</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:480.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">a week, Omori’s enlisted POWs did backbreaking labor at shipyards, railyards, truck-loading</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:498.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">stations, a sandpit, and a coalyard. Men had to be on the verge of death to be spared; minimum fever</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:515.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">levels for exemption were 40 degrees Celsius, or 104 degrees Fahrenheit. The labor was extremely</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:532.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">grueling; according to POW Tom Wade, each man at the Tokyo railyards lifted a total of twenty to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:549.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">thirty </span><span class="cls_002">tons</span><span class="cls_004"> of material a day. Probably because Omori was used as a show camp where prisoners</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:567.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">were displayed for the Red Cross, the men were “paid” ten yen per month—less than the price of a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:584.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">pack of cigarettes—but they were permitted to spend it only on a tiny selection of worthless goods at</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:601.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">a camp canteen, so the money came right back to the Japanese.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:618.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Compounding the hardship of Omori was the food situation. The rations were of better quality than</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:636.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">those at Ofuna but were doled out in only slightly larger quantities. Because officers weren’t</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:653.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">enslaved, they were allowed only half the ration given to slaves, on the justification that they needed</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:670.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">fewer calories. Along with rice, the men received some vegetables, but protein was almost</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:687.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">nonexistent. About once a week, someone would push a wheelbarrow into the camp, bearing “meat.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Because a wheelbarrow’s worth was spread over hundreds of men, a serving amounted to about a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:722.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">thimble-sized portion; it consisted of things like lungs and intestines, assorted dog parts, something</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:174.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">indifferent, enforcing the rules with blows but at least behaving predictably. Relatively speaking,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:308.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">On a Sunday morning, Watanabe approached some POWs crowded in a barracks doorway. A</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:325.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">POW named Derek Clarke piped up, “Gangway!” to clear a path. That one word sent Watanabe into</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:342.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">an explosion. He lunged at Clarke, beat him until he fell down, then kicked him. As Bush tried to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:360.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">explain that Clarke had meant no harm, Watanabe drew his sword and began screaming that he was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:377.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">going to behead Clarke. A Japanese officer stopped the attack, but that evening Watanabe turned on</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:394.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Bush, hurling him onto a scalding stove, then pummeling and kicking him. After Bush went to bed,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:411.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Watanabe returned and forced him to his knees. For three hours, Watanabe besieged Bush, kicking</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:429.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">him and hacking off his hair with his sword. He left for two hours, then returned again. Bush expected</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:446.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to be murdered. Instead, Watanabe took him to his office, hugged him, and gave him beer and handfuls</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:463.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">of candy and cigarettes. Through tears, he apologized and promised never to mistreat another POW.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:480.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">His resolution didn’t last. Later that night, he picked up a kendo stick—a long, heavy training sword</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:498.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">—and ran shrieking into a barracks, clubbing every man he saw.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:567.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Watanabe attacked Clarke, POW officers who had barely noticed him began looking at him with</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:584.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">terror. The consequence of his outburst answered a ravening desire: Raw brutality gave him sway</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:601.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">over men that his rank did not. “He suddenly saw after he hit a few men that he was feared and</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:636.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Watanabe derived another pleasure from violence. According to Hatto, Watanabe was a sexual</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:36.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">eyelid would sag a moment before he snapped.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:54.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Very quickly, Watanabe gained a fearsome reputation throughout Japan. Officials at other camps</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:71.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">began  sending  troublesome  prisoners  to  Watanabe  for</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:367.29px;top:71.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">“polishing,”  and  Omori  was  dubbed</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:88.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">“punishment camp.” In the words of Commander Maher, who’d been transferred from Ofuna to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">become the ranking Omori POW, Watanabe was “the most vicious guard in any prison camp on the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:123.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">main island of Japan.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:140.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Two things separated Watanabe from other notorious war criminals. One was the emphasis that he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:157.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">placed on emotional torture. Even by the standards of his honor-conscious culture, he was unusually</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:174.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">consumed by his perceived humiliation, and was intent upon inflicting the same pain on the men under</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:192.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">his power. Where men like the Quack were simply goons, Watanabe combined beatings with acts</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:209.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">meant to batter men’s psyches. He forced men to bow at pumpkins or trees for hours. He ordered a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:226.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">clergyman POW to stand all night saluting a flagpole, shouting the Japanese word for “salute,” </span><span class="cls_002">keirei;</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:243.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the experience left the man weeping and out of his mind. He confiscated and destroyed POWs’ family</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:261.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">photographs, and brought men to his office to show them letters from home, then burned the unopened</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:278.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">letters in front of them. To ensure that men felt utterly helpless, he changed the manner in which he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:295.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">demanded to be addressed each day, beating anyone who guessed wrong. He ordered men to violate</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:312.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">camp policies, then attacked them for breaking the rules. POW Jack Brady summed him up in one</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:330.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">sentence. “He was absolutely the most sadistic man I ever met.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:347.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The other attribute that separated Watanabe from fellow guards was his inconsistency. Most of the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:364.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">time, he was the wrathful god of Omori. But after beatings, he sometimes returned to apologize, often</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">in tears. These fits of contrition usually lasted only moments before the shrieking and punching began</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">again. He would spin from serenity to raving madness in the blink of an eye, usually for no reason.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:416.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">One POW recalled seeing him gently praise a POW, fly into a rage and beat the POW unconscious,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:433.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">then amble to his office and eat his lunch with the placidity of a grazing cow.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:450.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">When Watanabe wasn’t thrashing POWs, he was forcing them to be his buddies. He’d wake a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:468.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">POW in the night and be “nice as pie,” asking the man to join him in his room, where he’d serve</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:485.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">cookies and talk about literature. Sometimes he’d round up anyone in camp who could play an</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:502.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">instrument or sing, bring them to his room, and host a concert. He expected the men to respond as if</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:519.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">they adored him, and at times, he seemed to honestly believe that they did.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:537.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Maybe he held these gatherings because they left the POWs feeling more stressed than if he were</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:554.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">consistently hostile. Or maybe he was just lonely. Among the Japanese at Omori, Watanabe was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:571.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">despised for his haughtiness, his boasts about his wealth, and his curtness. He made a great show of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:588.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">his education, droning on about nihilism and giving pompous lectures on French literature at NCO</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:606.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">meetings. None of his colleagues listened. It wasn’t the subject matter; it was simply that they loathed</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:623.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">him.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:640.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Perhaps this is why he turned to POWs for friendship. The tea parties, wrote Derek Clarke, were</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:657.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">“tense, sitting-on-the-edge-of-a-volcano affairs.” Any misstep, any misunderstood word might set</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:675.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Watanabe off, leaving him smashing teapots, upending tables, and pounding his guests into oblivion.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:692.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">After the POWs left, Watanabe seemed to feel humiliated by having had to force friendship from</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:709.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">lowly POWs. The next day he would often deliver a wild-eyed whipping to the previous night’s</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:744.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Like any bully, he had a taste for a particular type of victim. Enlisted men usually received only the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:315.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">never refer to him by his real name. Such was Watanabe’s paranoia that he often hid outside the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:123.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">this deranged corporal was fixated on Louie, hunting the former Olympian, whom he would call</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:140.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">“number one prisoner.” Louie tried to conceal himself in groups of men, but the Bird always found</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:157.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">him. “After the first few days in camp,” Louie said, “I looked for him like I was looking for a lion</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:174.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">loose in the jungle.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:291.01px;top:207.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">——</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:239.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">When Louie woke each morning, the first thing that he thought of was the Bird. He’d look for the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:273.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">breakfast, the enlisted men were assembled into work parties and marched away. With the camp</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">population drastically diminished by the exodus, Louie had no crowds to hide in. The Bird was on</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:308.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">him immediately.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:325.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The one good thing about being an officer in Omori was that one was exempt from slave labor,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:342.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">albeit at the painful cost of half of the standard ration. But soon after Louie’s arrival, the Bird called</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:360.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">out the officers and announced that from now on, they’d labor at the work sites alongside the enlisted</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:377.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">men. When a man protested that this violated international law, the Bird swung his kendo stick</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:394.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">straight into the man’s head. The Bird approached the next man, who also said he wouldn’t work.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:411.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Again the kendo stick banged down. Louie was the third man. Trying to avoid getting his head</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:429.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">cracked open, he blurted out a compromise idea. They’d love to work within the camp, he said,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:446.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">making it a better place.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:463.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The Bird paused. He seemed to feel that as long as he forced the officers to work, he was winning.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:480.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">He sent them into a shack and ordered them to stitch up leather ammunition pouches, backpacks, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:498.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">equipment covers for the Japanese military. Louie and the other men were kept there for about eight</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:515.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">hours a day, but they worked only when the Bird was around, and even then, they deliberately stitched</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:532.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the leather improperly.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:549.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The Bird’s next move was to announce that from now on, the officers would empty the </span><span class="cls_002">benjos</span><span class="cls_004">.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:584.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was a tall order. Louie and the other officers used “honey dippers”—giant ladles—to spoon waste</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:601.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">from the pits into buckets, then carried the buckets to cesspits outside the camp. The work was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:618.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">nauseating and degrading, and when heavy rains came, the waste oozed out of the cesspits and back</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:636.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">into camp. To deprive the Bird of the pleasure of seeing them miserable, the men made a point of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:653.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">being jolly. Martindale created the “Royal Order of the </span><span class="cls_002">Benjo.</span><span class="cls_004">”</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:36.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">switched mailing labels, rewrote delivery addresses, and changed the labeling on boxcars, sending</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:54.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">tons of goods to the wrong destinations. They threw fistfuls of dirt into gas tanks and broke anything</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">engines would never run. POWs loading at docks “accidentally” dropped fragile items, including a</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:174.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">signed “Winston Churchill.” They drank huge quantities of tea and peed profusely on nearly every bag</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:192.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">of rice they loaded. And in one celebrated incident, POWs loading heavy goods onto a barge hurled</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:209.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the material down with such force that they sank the barge, blocking a canal. After a Herculean effort</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:278.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">enslaved at a railyard, they noticed that a group of track workers had neglected to put their tools</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:295.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">away. When their guard became absorbed in wooing a pretty girl, the POWs sprinted from their</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:312.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">stations, snatched up the tools, dashed over to a section of track, wrenched the pins and bolts out, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:330.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">rushed back to their work. The guard, still talking to the girl, noticed nothing. A switch engine</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:347.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">chugged in, pulling several boxcars. The engine hit the sabotaged strip, the rails shot out from under</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:364.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">it, and the entire train tipped over. No one was hurt, but the Japanese were frantic. They looked to the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">POWs, who kept working, their faces devoid of expression. The Japanese began screaming</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">accusations at one another.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:416.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">As dangerous as these acts were, for the POWs, they were transformative. In risking their necks to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:433.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">sabotage their enemy, the men were no longer passive captives. They were soldiers again.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:450.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">What the POWs couldn’t sabotage, they stole. They broke into shipping boxes, tapped bottles,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:468.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">lifted storage room doors off their hinges, raided ships’ galleys, and crawled up factory chutes.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:485.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Scottish POWs who worked in the Mitsubishi food warehouse ran the most sophisticated operation.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:502.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">When the Japanese took their shoe sizes for work boots, the men asked for boots several sizes too</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:519.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">big. They knitted special socks, some four feet long, and hoarded hollow bamboo reeds. Once at the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:537.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">sites, they leaned casually against sugar sacks, stabbed the reeds in, then ran the reeds into the socks,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:554.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">allowing sugar to pour through the reeds until the socks were full. Others tied up their pant cuffs,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:571.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">stuck the reeds in their waistbands, and filled their pants with sugar. Each load was deposited in a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:588.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">secret compartment in the latrine, to be retrieved at day’s end.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:606.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Each evening, Louie saw the slaves tramping back in, their clothes packed with booty. The critical</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:623.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">moment came when inspection was called. Men would deftly pass contraband, or the men bearing it,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:640.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">around during the searches, while the guards’ backs were turned. McMullen would hide fish in his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:657.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">sleeves; when patted down, he’d hold his arms up and grip the fish tails so they wouldn’t slide out.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:675.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The biggest trick was hiding the POWs who arrived fall-down drunk after chugging down any alcohol</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:692.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">that they couldn’t smuggle. The drunken men were shuffled into the center of the lineup, their</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:709.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">shoulders pinched between the shoulders of sober men, so that they wouldn’t pitch face forward into</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:88.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">fists, bats, and rifle butts. But the men were fed so little and worked so hard that they felt they had to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">steal to survive. They set up a “University of Thievery,” in which “professors”—the most adept</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:123.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">thieves—taught the art of stealing. The final exam was a heist. When men were caught stealing, POW</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:140.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">officers suggested that the culprits be transferred to sites that didn’t carry food. The Japanese agreed,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:157.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and the POW officers then replaced the inept thieves with University of Thievery alumni.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:174.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Though Louie, as an officer, had no opportunity to steal, he was quickly integrated into the thieving</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:192.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">system, rolling tobacco leaves for drying and putting them up in secret “wall safes” to cure. Once the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:209.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">leaves were properly aged, Louie would return to shave them into smokable shreds.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:226.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Thanks to the stealing, a black market with a remarkable diversity of goods flourished in camp.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:243.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">One group stole all the ingredients for a cake, only to discover, upon baking it, that the flour was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:261.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">actually cement. Because there were so many men, there wasn’t a lot of loot to go around, but</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:278.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">everyone benefited in some way. Whenever the thieves had something extra, they gave it to Louie,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:295.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">who still wasn’t managing to gain weight. A few times, they even smuggled him smoked oysters.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:312.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie devoured them and tiptoed to the fence to pitch the cans into Tokyo Bay.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:330.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Stolen food, especially the Scots’ sugar, was the camp currency, and the “sugar barons” became</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:347.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the rich men of Omori, even hiring assistants to do their laundry. The Scots drove hard bargains, but</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:364.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">they also donated one-quarter of the loot to sick POWs. One night, when he found Frank Tinker</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">deathly ill, Louie waited for the guards to pass, snuck to the Scots’ barracks, and told them that Tinker</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was in trouble. The Scots sent Louie back to Tinker with a load of sugar, no charge. Tinker would</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:416.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">later say that Louie’s sugar run “saved my soul.” According to Martindale, Tinker wasn’t the only</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:433.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">man saved. Deaths from illness and malnutrition had once been commonplace, but after the thievery</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:450.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">school was created, only two POWs died, one from a burst appendix. And in a place predicated on</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:468.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">degradation, stealing from the enemy won back the men’s dignity.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:549.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">randomly, every day, pounding his face and head. Any resistance from Louie, even shielding his face,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:567.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">would inspire the Bird to more violence. Louie could do nothing but stand there, staggering, as the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:584.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Bird struck him. He couldn’t understand the corporal’s fixation on him, and was desperate for</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:618.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">During one of the Bird’s attacks, Louie saw the camp commander, Kaname Sakaba, step out of his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:636.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">office and look toward him. Louie felt relief, thinking that now that Sakaba had seen this abuse of a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:653.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">POW by a lowly corporal, here at a show camp, he’d put a stop to it. But Sakaba watched</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:670.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">indifferently, then walked back inside. Subsequent beatings, of Louie and of others, were no different.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:687.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Other Japanese officers watched, some looking on approvingly, others looking dismayed. Sometimes,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:722.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">According to camp accountant Yuichi Hatto, this strange situation was the result of a wrinkle in</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:120.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">into his view. The corporal rushed down the barracks and halted before Louie. He wore the webbed</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:138.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">belt that Louie had seen on him his first day in Omori. The buckle was several inches square, made of</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:256.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Later that day, the phone rang at the Zamperinis’ house. The caller was a woman from the nearby</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:273.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">suburb of San Marino. She said that she’d been listening to her radio when the station had aired an</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">intercepted broadcast of an American prisoner of war speaking on Japanese radio. The broadcast had</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:308.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">been scratchy and indistinct, but she was sure that she had heard the name right. The POW she had</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:325.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">heard, she said, was Louie.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:342.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The Zamperinis were shocked and wary. The woman was a stranger, and they were afraid that she</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:360.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was a prankster. Sylvia and Louise asked for her address and drove to her house. The woman told</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:394.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">they didn’t know if they could believe the broadcast itself. It could easily have been faked. “I was</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:54.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Among the POWs was a chronically unwashed, ingenious, and possibly insane kleptomaniac named</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:71.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Mansfield. Shortly before Christmas, Mansfield broke into the storehouse—slipping past seven</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:88.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">guards—and made off with several Red Cross packages, which he buried under his barracks.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Discovering his cache, guards locked him in a cell. Mansfield broke out, stole sixteen more parcels,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:123.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and snuck them back into his cell. He hid the contents of the packages in a secret compartment he’d</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:140.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">fashioned himself, marking the door with a message for other POWs: </span><span class="cls_002">Food, help yourself, lift here</span><span class="cls_004">.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:157.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Caught again, he was tied to a tree in the snow without food or water, wearing only pajamas, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:174.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">beaten. By one account, he was left there for ten days. Late one night, when Louie was walking back</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:192.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">from the </span><span class="cls_002">benjo</span><span class="cls_004">, he saw the camp interpreter, Yukichi Kano, kneeling beside Mansfield, draping a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:209.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">blanket over him. The next morning, the blanket was gone, retrieved before the Bird could see it.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:226.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Eventually, Mansfield was untied and taken to a civilian prison, where he flourished.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:243.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The one good consequence of this event was that in the storehouse, Mansfield had discovered a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:261.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Red Cross theatrical trunk. He told other POWs about it, and this gave the men the idea of boosting</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:278.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">morale by staging a Christmas play. They secured the Bird’s approval by stroking his ego, naming</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:295.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">him “master of ceremonies” and giving him a throne at the front of the “theater”—the bathhouse—</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:312.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">outfitted with planks perched on washtubs to serve as a stage. The men decided to put on a musical</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Gonna Riere. Louie thought it was the funniest thing he’d ever seen. Private Kano translated for the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:416.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">night, he let Louie and the others be.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:433.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">At Zentsuji, Christmas came to Phil and Fred Garrett. Some POWs scrounged up musical</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:450.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">instruments and assembled in the camp. Before seven hundred starving men, they played rousing</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:468.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">music as the men sang along. They ended with the national anthems of England, Holland, and the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:485.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">United States. The Zentsuji POWs stood together at attention in silence, thinking of home.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:549.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">After Christmas, the Bird abruptly stopped attacking the POWs, even Louie. He paced about camp,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:567.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">brooding. The men watched him and wondered what was going on.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:584.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Several times that year, a dignitary named Prince Yoshitomo Tokugawa had come to camp. A</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:601.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">prominent and influential man, reportedly a descendant of the first shogun, Tokugawa was touring</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:618.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">camps for the Japanese Red Cross. At Omori, he met with POW Lewis Bush, who told him about the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:636.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Bird’s cruelty.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:653.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The Bird was suspicious. After Tokugawa first visited, the Bird forbade Bush from speaking to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:670.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">him again. When the prince returned, Bush defied the Bird, who beat him savagely as soon as the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:687.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">prince left. Tokugawa kept coming, and Bush kept meeting with him. The Bird slugged and kicked</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Bush, but Bush refused to be cowed. Deeply troubled by what he heard, Tokugawa went to the war</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:722.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">office and the Red Cross and pushed to have something done about Watanabe. He told Bush that he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:739.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was encountering resistance. Then, just before the New Year, the prince at last succeeded. The Bird</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:2.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Tokugawa’s victory was a hollow one. Officials made no effort to take the Bird out of contact with</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:19.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">POWs. They simply ordered his transfer to a distant, isolated camp, where he’d have exactly the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:36.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">same sway over prisoners, without the prying eyes of the prince and the Red Cross. Ensuring that no</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:54.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">censure of Watanabe was implied, Colonel Sakaba promoted him to sergeant.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:71.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The Bird threw himself a good-bye party and ordered some of the POW officers to come. The</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:88.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">officers dashed around camp to gather stool samples from the greenest dysentery patients, mixed up a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">ferocious gravy, and slathered it over a stack of rice cakes. When they arrived at the party, they</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:123.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">presented the cakes to the Bird as a token of their affection. While the men lavished the Bird with</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:140.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">lamentations on how they’d miss him, the Bird ate heartily. He seemed heartbroken to be leaving.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:157.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Later that day, Louie looked out of the barracks and saw the Bird standing by the gate in a group of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:174.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">people, shaking hands. All of the POWs were in a state of high animation. Louie asked what was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:192.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">happening, and someone told him that the Bird was leaving for good. Louie felt almost out of his head</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:209.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">with joy.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:498.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">customary in Japan—then yoked themselves to the cart like oxen and pulled it to and from the farm.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:636.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">relatively easy. Ogawa was a placid man, and though he carried a club, he never used it. The plot had</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:653.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">a clean well, a relief after the stinking camp water, and Ogawa let the men drink all they wished. And</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:670.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">because they were now working outside the camp, the officers were granted full rations. Though those</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:295.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">were lazy. Ogawa meant no harm, but the remark sent the Bird into a fury. He shouted for the farm</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:312.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">workers to line up before him, then began berating them for their indolence. He stormed and frothed,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:330.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">seeming completely deranged.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:364.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">coal on barges. If they refused, he would execute every one of them. One look at the Bird told</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:480.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">It was a short walk into slavery. The officers were taken to the riverbank and crowded onto a barge,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:498.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">which was heaped with coal destined for the steel mill. Six men were given shovels; Louie and the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:515.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">rest were given large baskets and told to strap them to their backs. Then, on the guards’ orders, the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:532.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">shovelers began heaving coal into each man’s basket. As a cubic foot of loose coal can weigh as</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:549.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">much as sixty pounds, the bearers were soon staggering. Once the baskets were full, the bearers were</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:567.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">ordered to lug the loads off the barge and up the shore to a railroad car, where they wobbled up a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:584.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">narrow, steep ramp, dumped the coal into the car, and returned to have their baskets refilled.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:601.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">All day the men shoveled and hauled. The guards kept the basket men moving at a rapid clip. By</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:618.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the time the guards finally let them stop, the men were utterly exhausted; by Wade’s estimate, over the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:636.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">course of the day, each basket bearer had carried well over four tons of coal.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:653.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">So began a daily routine. Each time the men finished clearing one barge, they were pushed aboard</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:670.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">another, and the hauling went on, punishing their bodies and numbing their minds. Somewhere along</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:19.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Japan. About three-quarters of a mile out, the barge drew alongside an anchored coal ship and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:36.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">stopped, the sea heaving under it, water spraying over the deck. Standing before the prisoners, a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:54.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">guard gestured to a net slung over the side of the ship. Jump from the barge onto the net, he said, then</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:71.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">climb up onto the ship’s deck.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:88.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The POWs were appalled. On the tossing sea, the two vessels were pitching up and down, crashing</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">together and rolling apart, and the net was a rapidly moving target. If the men mistimed their jumps,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:123.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">they’d be caught between the crafts as they collided or thrown into the water as they gapped apart.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:140.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The men balked, but the guards forced them forward, and the POWs began jumping. Louie, as scared</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:157.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">as everyone else, sprang across and climbed clear.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:174.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">He was hustled into the ship’s hold. Before him stood a giant dome of coal and, beside it, a large</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:192.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">hanging net. As he was given a shovel, the guards suddenly teemed around him, screaming at him to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:209.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">get to work. Louie jammed his shovel into the coal and began piling it into the net.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:226.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Hour after hour, Louie stooped over his shovel in a churning cloud of black dust. The guards turned</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:243.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">circles around him and the others, shouting and cracking them with clubs and kendo sticks. They</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:261.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">pushed the POWs at such a frenzied pace that the laborers never had a moment to straighten their</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:278.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">backs. Clubbed and badgered, Louie shoveled so frantically that the men alongside him whispered to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:295.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">him to slow down. At last, in the evening, the work was halted. The POWs were taken back to shore</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:312.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and dropped there, so caked in coal that they were virtually indistinguishable.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:330.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Every morning, the men were sent back to take up their shovels again. Every night, they dragged</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:347.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">back into camp, a long line of blackened ghosts trudging into the barracks and falling onto their bunks,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:364.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">weary to their bones, spitting black saliva. There was just one bathtub in camp, and its water was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">almost never changed. The one other place to bathe was a vat at the steel mill, but the guards marched</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:416.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">men lived in a patina of soot, waiting to go to the mill. Eventually, Wade felt so befouled that he had</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:450.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Day after day, Louie shoveled. Occasionally, he was switched from coal to industrial salt; the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:468.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">work was just as taxing, and the salt liquefied in his sweat and ran down his back, burning fissures in</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:502.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">during a nonstop fourteen-hour shift, he ordered the POWs to stop and told the foreman that he</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:554.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Tragedy was inevitable, and Louie was there when it happened. He was standing on the barge,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:588.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">side of the ship just as it collided with the barge. Crushed between the vessels, the man crumpled</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:606.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">onto the barge. The guards hardly paused, pushing Louie to make his jump. While the rest of the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:623.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">POWs tramped past him, the injured man was left where he lay. Louie never learned if he survived.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:140.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Whitfield devised a new plan. Preparing a bottle of saline solution and glucose to serve as a</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:226.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">dose, using the stools of six ill POWs. This time, they hit the jackpot.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:278.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">ordered Weinstein to cure him. Weinstein gave him what he said were sulfa pills. Suspicious, the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:295.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Bird made Weinstein take some of the pills himself. Weinstein took them, knowing that all that was in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:312.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">them was aspirin and baking soda. The Bird lost fifteen pounds in one week. Weinstein urged him to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:330.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">eat his rice.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:347.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">With the Bird out of the way, the men and even the guards were, wrote Weinstein, “almost</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:364.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">hysterically childish” in their delight. But the Bird seemed unmurderable. After ten days, his fever</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">broke. He returned to Naoetsu to take out his rage on the officers and Louie.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:291.01px;top:414.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">——</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:446.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">By June, Louie’s leg was healed enough to bear his weight, and he was sent back to shovel coal and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:463.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">salt. He was growing ever sicker, and his dysentery never eased. When he appealed for rest while</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:480.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">burning up with fever, the Bird refused him. His temperature was only 103, he said; you go to work.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:498.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie went.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:515.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">One day that month, Louie, Tinker, and Wade were shoveling on a barge when the foreman</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:532.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">discovered that fish had been stolen from the galley. The foreman announced that if the thieves didn’t</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:549.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">turn themselves in, he’d report the theft to the Bird. During a lunch break, the innocent men persuaded</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:567.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the culprits to confess. When the men walked into camp that night, the foreman told the Bird anyway,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:584.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">as he suspected that more men had been in on the theft.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:601.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The Bird called for the work party to line up before him and ordered the thieves to stand before the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:618.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">group. He then walked down the line, pulling out Wade, Tinker, Louie, and two other officers and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:636.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">making them stand with the thieves. He announced that these officers were responsible for the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:653.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">behavior of the thieves. His punishment: Each enlisted man would punch each officer and thief in the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:670.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">face, as hard as possible.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:687.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The chosen men looked at the line of enlisted men in terror: there were some one hundred of them.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Any man who refused to carry out the order, the Bird said, would meet the same fate as the officers</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:722.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and thieves. He told the guards to club any men who didn’t strike the chosen men with maximum</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:739.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">force.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:756.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The enlisted men had no choice. At first, they tried to hit softly, but the Bird studied each blow.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:2.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">When a man didn’t punch hard enough, the Bird would begin shrieking and clubbing him, joined by</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:19.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the guards. Then the errant man would be forced to hit the victim repeatedly until the Bird was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:36.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">satisfied. Louie began whispering to each man to get it over with, and hit hard. Some of the British</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:54.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">men whispered, “Sorry, sir,” before punching Wade.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:71.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">For the first few punches, Louie stayed on his feet. But his legs soon began to waver, and he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:88.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">collapsed. He pulled himself upright, but fell again with the next punch, and then the next. Eventually,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">he blacked out. When he came to, the Bird forced the men to resume punching him, screaming, “</span><span class="cls_002">Next!</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:123.00px" class="cls_002"><span class="cls_002">Next! Next!</span><span class="cls_004">” In Louie’s whirling mind, the voice began to sound like the tramping of feet.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:140.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The sun sank. The beating went on for some two hours, the Bird watching with fierce and erotic</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:157.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">pleasure. When every enlisted man had done his punching, the Bird ordered the guards to club each</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:174.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">one twice in the head with a kendo stick.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:192.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The victims had to be carried to the barracks. Louie’s face was so swollen that for several days he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:209.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">could barely open his mouth. By Wade’s estimate, each man had been punched in the face some 220</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">June 1945 became July. Every day, a single B-29 crossed over Naoetsu, so high that only the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:308.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">contrails gave it away. The men called it “the Lone Ranger.” Every night, bombers passed over in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:325.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">strength, forests of planes brushing over the village. To the POWs, they were a beautiful sight, “all lit</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:360.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">air-raid sirens kept kicking in. Sometimes, at night, the men could hear soft booming in the darkness.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:377.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie was sick and demoralized. He lay on his plank, daydreaming about the Olympics, holding</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:394.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">them before himself as a shining promise, a future for which to endure an unbearable present. He</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:411.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">prayed ceaselessly for rescue. His nightmares of his battles with the Bird were hellish, unbearable.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:429.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">His hope was dimming. In his barracks one day, a man dragged in from slave work, looking spent. He</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:446.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">lay down, asked to be awakened for dinner, and went still. At chowtime, Louie kicked his foot. The</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:463.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">man didn’t move. He was dead. He was young, like everyone else, and hadn’t even looked sick.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:480.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The food situation was increasingly dire. In the spring, with the import of the Kobe and Osaka</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:498.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">POWs, the camp population had more than doubled, but the rations had not. Now the rations were</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:515.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">smaller still, usually consisting of nothing but seaweed. When a famished prisoner tried to get food</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:532.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">from civilians, the Bird broke his jaw. Several POW officers appealed to the authorities for meat; to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:549.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">withhold it, they said, violated international law. After this appeal, two guards left camp and returned</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:567.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">with a dog, reportedly the only one left in Naoetsu. The next morning, a bell rang, and Louie walked</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:584.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">into the compound. There, impaled on a post facing the POWs, was the dog’s skinned head. A few</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:601.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">minutes later, the men were served breakfast. In the bowls were the remains of the dog.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:636.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">winter with dread. They were told that both their rations and the barracks heating fuel were going to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:653.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">be cut more come winter, and might be halted altogether. Many of the men were already so thin and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:670.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">sick that they were, wrote one, “hanging on from day to day.” Few POWs, in Naoetsu or anywhere</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:687.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">else, thought they’d live to see another spring. At Omori, someone made up a slogan: “Frisco dive in</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:722.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">There was a worry more pressing yet. Even in isolated Naoetsu, it was obvious to the POWs that</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:739.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the Japanese empire was staggering. Watching B-29s crossing over with impunity, they knew that</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:36.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">that they stopped stealing at the work sites. It was clear to them that Japan had long ago lost this war.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:261.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">notoriously sadistic camp official began speaking of his empathy for the POWs, and how a new camp</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:278.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was being prepared where there was ample food, medical care, and no more forced labor. The POWs</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:212.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Kono, would pace back and forth, shouting and swinging clubs, kendo sticks, or rifles. On some</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:246.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">other’s faces. Sometimes he and Kono would make them stand with their arms over their heads for</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:363.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie’s job as pig custodian was over. Barge loading had also been canceled; Allied planes had sunk</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:397.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">rations. Limping, sick, and hungry, he begged the Bird for work so he could get full rations again. The</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:414.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Bird brought him a paper-thin gray goat that appeared to be on the brink of death.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:449.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie had nothing to secure the goat with, and no pen to put him in. His friend Ken Marvin stole a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:466.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">rope from his work site and brought it to him. Louie tied the goat to a pole and began nursing him,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:483.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">giving him water and grain. At night he tied him inside a grain shack. The goat only got sicker.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:501.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">One morning, the Bird ordered Louie to come before him. He said that the goat had gotten loose,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:518.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">broken into a grain bin, and gorged himself. The animal was deathly ill, and it was Louie’s fault.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:535.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie knew that his knot had been secure. If the goat had gotten loose, someone had untied him. The</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:587.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">serious. Risking being seen by the Bird, he went to the camp doctor to plead for medication. The Bird</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:604.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">ran him down, demanding to know if he had received permission to approach the doctor. Louie said</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:639.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The Bird marched Louie away from the doctor’s shack, passing Tinker and Wade, who’d been</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:708.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the beam up. The Bird called a guard over. If the prisoner lowers his arms, the Bird told him, hit him</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:34.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">That night was a turning point for Louie. The next morning, his dysentery was suddenly extremely</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:51.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">severe. He was dangerously dehydrated and beginning to have trouble eating. Each day he was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:69.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">thinner, weaker.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:86.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Every day and night, the B-29s raked over the sky and the Bird rampaged through camp. He</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:103.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">attacked Ken Marvin, knocked him unconscious, roused him with a bucket of water to his face, told</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:120.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">him to take care of his health, then knocked him out again. While Louie hid upstairs on his bunk, sick</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:138.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">with fever, he saw the Bird and Kono beat two sick POWs until they acquiesced to the Bird’s order</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:155.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to lick excrement from their boots. On another day, Louie looked across the compound to see the Bird</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:172.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and Kono standing before a line of POWs, holding a confiscated book on boxing and taking turns</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:189.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">punching the prisoners.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:207.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie was walking in the compound when the Bird collared him and dragged him to the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:241.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">their stomachs, on top of the waste pits, and ordered them to do push-ups. Louie was just barely able</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:258.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to hold his body clear of the pit. Others were not so fortunate. When the exhausted men failed to push</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:276.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">themselves all the way up, the Bird pressed the butt of his rifle to their heads and ground their faces</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:293.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">into the waste.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:310.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Then came the day that Louie had been dreading. He was standing outside, filling a tub of water,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:327.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">when the Bird barked at him to come over. When Louie arrived, the Bird looked wrathfully at him</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:345.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and gestured toward the water.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:362.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">“Tomorrow I’m going to drown you.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:379.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie spent a day gripped with fear, looking for the Bird, thinking about the tub of water. When the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:396.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Bird found him, he was terrified.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:414.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">“I have changed my mind,” the Bird said. Then he lunged at Louie and began punching him in the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:431.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">face, alternating right and left fists in a violent ecstasy. As abruptly as he had started, he stopped.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:448.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Suddenly serene, he let go of Louie.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:465.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">“I will drown you tomorrow,” he said.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:483.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The Bird strolled away. His face wore the same soft languor that Louie had seen on the face of the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:500.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Quack after he beat Harris at Ofuna. It was an expression of sexual rapture.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:291.01px;top:532.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">——</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:564.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie could take no more. He joined about a dozen officers in a secret meeting. By the time they</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:582.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">parted, they had a plan to kill the Bird.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:599.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The plan was simple. The men would leap onto the Bird and pull him to the top floor of the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:616.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">barracks, overlooking the drop to the Hokura River. There, they would lash him to a large rock and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:633.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">shove him out the window. When he struck the water below, the rock would carry him under. He</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:651.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">would never draw another breath.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:668.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The officers divvied up the tasks involved in the killing. A group of men would figure out how to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:685.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">overpower the Bird, who was quite fit and would be difficult to subdue. Several of the biggest POWs</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:702.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">would find a heavy but portable rock and, out of view of the guards, hoist it up the ladders and roll it</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:720.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to the window. Louie was tasked with stealing enough strong rope to lash the rock to the Bird.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:737.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie couldn’t find a rope long enough to tie a man to a boulder. He began stealing shorter lengths</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:754.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">of rope, secreting them away, then tying them together with his strongest Boy Scout knots. Meanwhile,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:2.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the rock crew found a large boulder, big enough to drown the Bird and several other men. Somehow,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:19.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">they got it into the compound, into the barracks, and up the ladder without discovery. They positioned</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:36.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">it by the window. When Louie had finally stolen enough rope, he tied it into one long line. It was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:54.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">looped around the rock, a dangling end lying ready to be wound around the Bird’s body. Louie then</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:71.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">prepared for the second phase of the plan. He had volunteered to be one of the men to capture the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:88.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Bird, drag him up, and throw him to his death.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">As the conspirators planned, the Bird entered the barracks. If the rock was then in place, he either</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:157.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">each of the Japanese officials. When the Bird looked up, he saw the man sneering at him.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:174.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The Bird was spooked. He believed that he saw the POWs glaring murderously at him. They had</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:192.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">never looked at him in this way before. He knew that Japan was losing the war, and that when the end</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:209.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">came, the Americans would try him. These POWs would accuse him of crimes, and the Americans</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:226.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">would surely sentence him to death. No one, he knew, would defend him, and that fact left him angry</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:243.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and panicked. He was going to have to go to extreme measures to save himself.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:261.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Next to a window near which the Bird passed each day, the rock and rope sat ready. From the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:377.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The mission was so secret that Tibbets carried cyanide capsules for all of the crewmen, to be used if</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:394.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">they crashed and were captured.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:411.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">As the day’s first light walked over the Pacific, the plane rose toward its bombing altitude, more</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:429.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">than thirty thousand feet. Two crewmen climbed into the bomb bay. There sat a twelve-foot-long,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:446.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">nine-thousand-pound bomb called Little Boy. The men dropped to their hands and knees and crawled</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:463.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">around the bomb, pulling out test plugs and replacing them with firing plugs. Little Boy was armed.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:480.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Crossing the Inland Sea, Tibbets saw a city ahead. A scout plane flying over it radioed back in</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:515.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Tibbets spoke over the interphone:</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:549.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The plane passed the coastline and crossed over the city. Tibbets turned the plane west, then</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:567.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">ordered his crew to don shaded goggles. Below, he saw a T-shaped bridge, the target. Tibbets</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:584.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">surrendered control of the plane to the Norden bombsight, and the bombardier lined up on the bridge.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:601.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">At 8:15.17, the bomb slipped from the plane. Tibbets turned the plane as hard as he could and put it</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:618.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">into a dive to gain speed. It would take forty-three seconds for the bomb to reach its detonation</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:636.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">altitude, a little less than two thousand feet. No one knew for sure if, in that brief time, the bomber</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Exactly as the thought crossed his mind, the sky over the city ripped open in a firestorm of color</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:140.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">something very different. Someone had heard that Naoetsu was slated to be bombed that night.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:364.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">taken down. As a test, some of the POWs removed the shades on the barracks windows. The guards</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">ordered them to put the shades back up. If the war had ended, the guards were going to considerable</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:411.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">It was the growl of an aircraft engine, huge, low, and close. The swimmers looked up, and at first</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:446.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">As the men watched, the bomber dove, leveled off, and skimmed over the water, its engine</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:463.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">screaming. The POWs looked up at it. The bomber was headed straight toward them.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:480.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In the instant before the plane shot overhead, the men in the water could just make out the cockpit</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:636.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">relief and rapture. Their fear of the guards, of the massacre they had so long awaited, was gone,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:653.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">dispersed by the roar and muscle of the bomber. The prisoners jumped up and down, shouted, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:670.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">sobbed. Some scrambled onto the camp roofs, waving their arms and singing out their joy to the pilot</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:687.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">above. Others piled against the camp fence and sent it crashing over. Someone found matches, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">soon, the entire length of fence was burning. The Japanese shrank back and withdrew.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:86.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">carried through the air westward, directly toward the river. Clift stood up, leaned over the water, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:103.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">reached out so far that he was on the verge of falling in. The object, a little wooden packet, dropped</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:88.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Trumbull was astonished. He took Louie aside and began asking questions, and Louie recounted his</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:187.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">orders to fly out, he begged a doctor to arrange for him to stay a little longer, on the grounds that he</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:394.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the storm to fight his way to an outhouse. He was on the seat with his pants down when a wind gust</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:411.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">shot the outhouse over an embankment, carrying Louie in it. Dumped in the mud under a downpour,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:621.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">telling the pilot his story, from the crash to Kwajalein to Japan. As Louie spoke, the pilot dropped the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:638.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">plane down over an island and landed. The pilot asked Louie if he’d ever seen this place before.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:655.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie looked around at a charred wasteland, recognizing nothing.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:724.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">of intense green. Now, he couldn’t find a single tree. The fight for this place had ripped the jungle off</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:258.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and told her that he had to escape, but asked her not to tell his mother. As Mutsuhiro was preparing to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:276.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">go, his little sister gave him a deck of playing cards, to be used for fortune-telling.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:293.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Wearing his uniform with the insignia torn off, Mutsuhiro packed a trunk with food and clothing and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:310.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">lugged it to a car. He drove to the rail station and walked onto the first train he saw, without checking</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:327.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">its destination. He hoped it would take him to someplace distant and obscure, but the train reached its</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:345.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">terminus only two towns down the line, at the metropolis of Kofu. He got off, wandered the station,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:362.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">then lay down and slept.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:379.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In the morning, he meandered around Kofu. Somewhere in the city, he passed a radio and heard his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:396.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">name listed among those wanted for war crimes. To learn that he was being sought was no surprise,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:414.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">but he was shocked to hear his name listed alongside that of Tojo. If his case was considered</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:431.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">comparable to that of Tojo, he thought, arrest would mean execution.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:448.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">At all costs, he vowed, he wouldn’t let himself fall into the hands of the Americans. He resolved to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:465.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">disappear forever.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:291.01px;top:498.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">——</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:530.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">As Mutsuhiro fled, the hunt for him began. Though they were now operating under the orders of their</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:547.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">former enemies, the Japanese police worked swiftly and energetically to round up war-crimes</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:564.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">suspects. The Watanabe case was no exception. After finding nothing at Mutsuhiro’s last known</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:582.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">address, police appeared at his mother’s door in Kusakabe. Shizuka Watanabe told them that her son</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:599.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">had been there, but had left. They had missed him by three days. Shizuka suggested that he might seek</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:616.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">refuge with his sister Michiko, who lived in Tokyo. She’d soon be visiting Michiko, she said, and if</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:633.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">she found Mutsuhiro there, she’d urge him to turn himself in.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:651.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The police seized on the lead. Shizuka gave them an address for Michiko, and they converged on it.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:668.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Not only was there no Michiko there, there was no house. Every home in the neighborhood had</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:685.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">burned long ago, in the firebombing.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:702.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Shizuka was now the focus of suspicion. On her regular visits to Tokyo, she always stayed with</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:720.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Michiko, and given that she was scheduled to do so that very week, she surely knew that her</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:737.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">daughter’s home had burned down. Shizuka’s misdirection of the detectives may have been an honest</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:754.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">mistake—Michiko had moved to a home down the same road, so the only change in the address was</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:36.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The police were a long way from giving up. Two detectives began tailing Shizuka and often came</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:88.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">searched. Police intercepted all of the family’s incoming and outgoing mail. They even had a stranger</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:140.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Widening the hunt, the police investigated Mutsuhiro’s former army roommates. The home of his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:157.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Omori commander was searched and put under surveillance. Mutsuhiro’s photograph was distributed</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:192.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Nagano Prefecture, where a Watanabe family mine was located, conducted special searches.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:209.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Detectives went through Mutsuhiro’s academic records and searched for his teachers and classmates,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:226.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">going back to his childhood. They even got hold of a love letter from a girl who had asked Mutsuhiro</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:261.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">They found only two leads. A former soldier told them that Mutsuhiro had spoken of his intention to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:278.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">flee to Fukuoka Prefecture to be a farmer. The soldier thought that Mutsuhiro would hide with a friend</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:295.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">named Yo. Police found Yo, questioned and investigated him, and questioned people in his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:312.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">neighborhood. It was a dead lead. Meanwhile, a detective at Mitsushima found a man who’d seen</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:330.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Mutsuhiro in August. The man said that Mutsuhiro had left, claiming to be headed for Tokyo, at the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:347.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">war’s end. But Mutsuhiro had gone to Kusakabe; there was no evidence that he’d gone to Tokyo. He</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:364.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">may have seeded his acquaintances with false information to misdirect his pursuers.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:381.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">There was one other possible clue. The man at Mitsushima mentioned something he had overheard</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Mutsuhiro say: He would rather kill himself than be captured. It seemed no idle threat; that fall,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:416.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">during a roundup of suspected war criminals, there was a wave of suicides among those sought.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:433.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Perhaps the Bird was already dead.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:450.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">While investigators combed Japan for Mutsuhiro, prosecutors were inundated with some 250 POW</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:468.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">affidavits concerning his actions in camps. These would be distilled into an 84-count indictment.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:485.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Even with each count stated with maximum brevity, in single spacing, the indictment stretched over</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:502.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">eight feet of paper. It would reflect only a tiny fraction of the crimes that POWs said Watanabe had</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:519.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">committed; Louie’s accusations of myriad attacks would make up only one count. Investigators</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:537.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">believed that they had far more evidence than they needed to have Watanabe convicted and put to</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:653.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">people wrote him letters. Press photographers tailed him. His attempts to sleep were invariably</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:670.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">interrupted by a ringing phone. Strangers teemed around him, pushing for news on what he’d do next.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:687.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Everyone wanted him to tell his story. The War Department booked him on a speaking tour, and he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was inundated with speaking invitations that usually came with an award, making them impossible to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:722.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">decline. In his first weeks home, staying with his parents, he gave ninety-five speeches and made</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:739.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">countless radio appearances. When he went to dinner clubs, the managers begged him to regale the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:756.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">guests. For Louie, all of the attention was drenching, a great noise, overpowering.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:19.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">grin and the springy cadence of his speech. But when Louie spoke of the war, Jordan sensed</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:36.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">something rustling just behind his eyes, a clamoring emotion pent up in a small space. He spoke not</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:54.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">with anger or anguish but with bewilderment. Sometimes he’d pause and drift off, a troubled</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie was struggling more than Jordan or anyone else knew. He was beginning to suffer bouts of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:123.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">suffocating anxiety. Each time he was asked to stand before a crowd and shape words around his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:140.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">private horror, his gut would wring. Every night, in his dreams, an apparition would form in his head</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:157.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and burn there. It was the face of the Bird, screaming, “</span><span class="cls_002">Next! Next! Next!</span><span class="cls_004">”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:174.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Very early one morning, Louie tiptoed from his room without telling anyone where he was going,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:192.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">slid into his Plymouth, put his foot on the gas, and didn’t stop until he was high in the mountains. He</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:312.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">were set before him, and he sipped them and felt his nerves unwinding. By the time he rose to speak,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:330.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">he was in a haze, and he rambled on for much too long. When he got back to his seat, he felt relieved.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:347.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The alcohol had brought him a pleasant numbness.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">broke out a bottle of Canadian Club whiskey and poured a shot into his coffee. That gave him a warm</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">feeling, so he had another shot. It couldn’t hurt to have a third. The whiskey floated him through that</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:416.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">speech, too, and so began a routine. A flask became his constant companion, making furtive</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:433.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">appearances in parking lots and corridors outside speaking halls. When the harsh push of memory ran</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:705.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and spread their towels near a pair of sunbathing women. When one of the women turned, Louie saw</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:722.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">that it was the beauty from the bar. He was hesitant to speak to her, afraid that he’d come off as a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:739.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">wolf, but Harry charged right in, regaling the women with Louie’s history. When Harry mentioned the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:54.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Her name was Cynthia Applewhite, and she was a few weeks past her twentieth birthday. Louie</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">beautiful. When they parted, Louie grumbled something about how she probably wouldn’t want to see</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:123.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">him again. “Maybe,” she said playfully, “I want to see you again.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:140.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie wasn’t the first guy to be felled by Cynthia. Dense forests of men had gone down at the sight</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:157.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">of her. She was dating two guys at once, both named Mac, and each Mac was trying to outlast the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:226.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">said yes.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:596.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">They seemed an unlikely pair. Cynthia was wealthy and pedigreed; she’d been educated in private</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:699.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">corners of the world. She was habitually defiant and fearless, and when she felt controlled, as she</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:106.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">wasn’t sure. Louie was undiscouraged. Before their walk was done, he had talked her into marrying</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:123.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">him. They had known each other for less than two weeks.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:175.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">for just days. Cynthia couldn’t be swayed, so Mrs. Applewhite refused to give her money to fly to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:192.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">California to get married. Cynthia vowed to get the money somehow, either by borrowing it or, in</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:244.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">mailman to bring him a pink envelope from Cynthia. Though the letters were adoring on both sides,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:261.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">they reveal how little the two knew about each other. Cynthia had no idea that Louie was losing his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:279.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">emotional equilibrium. From Harry, she knew a little about his time as a POW, but Louie had said</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:296.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">almost nothing. In his letters, the closest he came to addressing it was to joke that he hoped that she’d</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:313.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">go easy on rice and barley in her cooking. On one of their dates, Louie had gotten very drunk, but he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:330.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">had apologized and curbed himself from then on. Louie’s drinking may have struck Cynthia as</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:348.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">harmless, but it was in fact a growing problem. In critical ways, she was engaged to a stranger.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:365.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie seemed to be aware that in marrying her, he was asking more of her than she knew, and he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:382.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">frequently warned her of how much she was taking on. Still, he wanted a wedding as soon as</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">possible. “We have got to set a date early in June,” he wrote in mid-April, “or I’ll just go plain</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:417.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">crazy.” Soon after, he wrote that they had to marry in May. She told him that she’d help him forget his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:434.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">past, and he grasped her promise as a lifeline. “If you love me enough,” he wrote back, “I’ll have to</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:567.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to make a new man of himself, he quit drinking and smoking. He took terminal leave from the air</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:328.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">turned respectable profits, but each investment quickly ran its course. He did, however, earn a steady</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:345.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">enough income to rent an apartment for himself and Cynthia. It was only a tiny place in a low-rent</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:363.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">quarter of Hollywood, but Cynthia did her best to make it homey.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:414.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie, the belt flicking from his hand, lashing Louie’s face. Every night, he returned, and Louie was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:432.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">helpless once again, unable to flee him or drive him away.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:449.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie threw himself into training. His long hikes became runs. His strength was coming back, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:466.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">his dodgy leg gave him no pain. He took it slowly, thinking always of London in ’48. He was aiming</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:483.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">for the 1,500 meters, and assured himself that if he couldn’t make it, he’d return to the 5,000, or even</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:501.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the steeplechase. But without extending himself, he began clocking miles in 4:18, just two seconds</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:518.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">slower than the winning time of the Zamperini Invitational that he’d seen in March. He was coming</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:535.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">all the way back.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:552.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">But running wasn’t the same. Once he had felt liberated by it; now it felt forced. Running was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:570.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">joyless, but Louie had no other answer to his internal turmoil. He doubled his workouts, and his body</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:587.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">answered.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:604.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">One day, with Cynthia standing by, holding a stopwatch, Louie set off to see how fast he could turn</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:621.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">two miles. Early on, he felt a pulse of pain dart across his left ankle, just where it had been injured at</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:639.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Naoetsu. He knew better than to keep pushing, but pushing was all he knew now. As he completed the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:656.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">first mile, barbs of pain were crackling through his ankle. On he went, running for London.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:673.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Late in his last lap, there was an abrupt slicing sensation in his ankle. He half-hopped to the line</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:690.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and collapsed. His time was the fastest two-mile run on the Pacific coast in 1946, but it didn’t matter.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:708.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">He was unable to walk for a week, and would limp for weeks more. A doctor confirmed that he had</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:2.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie was wrecked. The quest that had saved him as a kid was lost to him. The last barricade within</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:19.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">him fell. By day, he couldn’t stop thinking about the Bird. By night, the sergeant lashed him, hungry</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:36.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and feral. As the belt whipped him, Louie would fight his way to his attacker’s throat and close his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:54.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">hands around it. No matter how hard he squeezed, those eyes still danced at him. Louie regularly</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:71.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">woke screaming and soaked in sweat. He was afraid to sleep.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:88.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">He started smoking again. There seemed no reason not to drink, so each evening, he swigged wine</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">as he cooked, leaving Cynthia sitting through dinner with a tipsy husband. Invitations to clubs kept</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:123.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">coming, and now it seemed harmless to accept the free drinks that were always offered. At first he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:140.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">drank just beer; then he dipped into hard liquor. If he got drunk enough, he could drown the war for a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:157.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">time. He soon began drinking so much that he passed out, but he welcomed it; passing out saved him</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:174.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">from having to go to bed and wait for his monster. Unable to talk him into giving it up, Cynthia</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:192.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">stopped going out with him. He left her alone each night while he went out to lose the war.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:209.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Rage, wild, random, and impossible to quell, began to consume him. Once he harassed a man for</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:226.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">walking too slowly on a crosswalk in front of his car, and the man spat at him. Louie gunned the car to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:243.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the curb, jumped out, and, as Cynthia screamed for him to stop, punched the man until he fell to the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:261.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">ground. On another day, when a man at a bar accidentally let a door swing into him, Louie chested up</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:278.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to him and provoked an embarrassing little scuffle that ended with Louie grinding the man’s face in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:295.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the dirt.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:312.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">His mind began to derail. While sitting at a bar, he heard a sudden, loud sound, perhaps a car</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:330.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">backfiring. Before he knew it, he was on the floor, cringing, as the bar fell silent and the patrons</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:347.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">stared. On another night, he was drinking, his mind drifting, when someone nearby yelled something</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:364.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">while joking with friends. In Louie’s mind, it was “</span><span class="cls_002">Keirei!</span><span class="cls_004">” He found himself jumping up, back</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">straight, head up, heart pounding, awaiting the flying belt buckle. In a moment the illusion cleared and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:399.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">he saw that, again, everyone in the bar was looking at him. He felt foolish and humiliated.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:416.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">One day Louie was overcome by a strange, inexplicable feeling, and suddenly the war was all</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:433.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">around and in him, not a memory but the actual </span><span class="cls_002">experience</span><span class="cls_004">—the glaring and grating and stench and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:450.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">howl and terror of it. In a moment he was jerked back out again, confused and frightened. It was his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:468.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">first flashback. After that, if he caught a glimpse of blood or saw a tussle in a bar, everything would</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:485.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">reassemble itself as prison camp, and the mood, the light, the sounds, his own body, would all be as</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:502.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">they were, inescapable. In random moments, he felt lice and fleas wriggling over his skin when there</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:519.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was nothing there. It only made him drink harder.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:537.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Cynthia urged Louie to get help, so he went, reluctantly, to see a counselor at a veterans’ hospital.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:554.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">He spoke of the war and the nightmares, and came home feeling as turbulent as when he’d left. After</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:571.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">two or three sessions, he quit.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:588.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">One day he opened a newspaper and saw a story that riveted his attention. A former Pacific POW</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:606.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">had walked into a store and seen one of his wartime captors. The POW had called the police, who’d</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:623.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">arrested the alleged war criminal. As Louie read the story, all of the fury within him converged. He</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:640.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">saw himself finding the Bird, overpowering him, his fists bloodying the face, and then his hands</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:657.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">locking about the Bird’s neck. In his fantasy, he killed the Bird slowly, savoring the suffering he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:675.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">caused, making his tormentor feel all of the pain and terror and helplessness that he’d felt. His veins</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:692.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">beat with an electric urgency.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:709.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie had no idea what had become of the Bird, but he felt sure that if he could get back to Japan,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:172.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">several other POW officers wrote a letter of commendation for him before they went home.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:189.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">It did no good. Kano was arrested and jailed as a suspected war criminal. Why he was fingered</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:207.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">remains unclear. He was mentioned in many POW affidavits and, in every one, was lauded for his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:224.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">kindness. Perhaps the explanation was that his last name was similar to those of two vicious men,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:276.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">He was neither charged nor questioned. He wrote a plaintive letter asking authorities to investigate</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:293.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">him so his name could be cleared. “Cross my heart,” he wrote, “I have not done anything wrong.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:310.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In the winter of 1946, Kano was finally cleared, and MacArthur ordered his release. Kano moved</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:327.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to Yokohama and worked for an import-export business. He missed his POW friends, but for years,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:345.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">he didn’t try to contact them. “I thought I should refrain from writing them,” he wrote to Martindale in</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:444.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In the mountain village where he was known as Saburo Ohta, Watanabe waited out a bitter winter.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:461.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The visit from the policeman shook him. After the policeman left, the farmer’s wife eyed Watanabe</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:478.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">with what seemed to be recognition. When night fell, Watanabe lay awake, mulling capture and</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:530.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">selling leather straps. The tour would take them through major cities where Watanabe was surely</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:547.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">being sought, but he was living on the good graces of the farmer and had to accept. Watanabe donned</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:564.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">glasses to obscure his features and headed off, filled with trepidation.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:582.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">They went to the busy port cities of Akita and Niigata. No one gave Watanabe a second look. As</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:599.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">his fear of being discovered eased, he began enjoying himself. The conversation in the cities was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:616.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">dominated by the war, and everyone had an opinion about the conduct of Japanese soldiers,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:633.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">especially those accused of war crimes. People talked of how the hunt for suspected war criminals</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:651.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was being conducted. Watanabe listened intently.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:668.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Being out in society made him long to see his family. He thought of how his mother would now be</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:685.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">in Tokyo, on her regular summer visit to his sister Michiko’s home. The yearning was overpowering.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:702.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Watanabe took out the fortune-telling cards that his little sister had given him and dealt himself a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:720.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">hand. The cards told him that if he went to his family, he’d be safe. On a sweltering day at the height</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:754.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">His timing couldn’t have been worse. The winter’s push to find Watanabe had yielded no clues,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:54.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">required to register changes of address, police were ordered to pore over registries in search of men</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:295.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">family would fare better if they didn’t know. As time passed, the family members grew anxious,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:312.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">afraid that the detectives would catch them. They’d been there just two days previously. At two</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:364.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">There was shuffling outside. The detectives had arrived. The Watanabes sprang up. Someone</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:416.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">of detectives entered the room that he had just left. He heard them questioning his mother and sister,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:485.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">there was a closet. Ever so slowly, he inched open the closet’s sliding door and squeezed inside. He</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:502.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">decided not to close the door, fearing that it would make noise. He stood there, a hand clasped over</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:264.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">hangers-on, all trying to exploit him. One of them talked Louie into investing $7,000 in a plan to</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:298.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">signed the check, and that was the last he saw of either the investor or his money. He formed a</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:436.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Drinking granted him a space of time in which to let it all go. Slowly, inexorably, he’d gone from</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:505.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">insisted on bringing home so much liquor that he had to take out his Chevy’s back seat to fit it all in.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:522.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">He had become someone he didn’t recognize. One night at a bar on Sunset Boulevard, he parked</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:540.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">himself on a stool, drank all evening, and wound up stinking drunk. A man passed behind him,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:557.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">ushering his date past. Louie swung around, reached out, and groped the woman’s bottom. The next</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:591.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">with pain, and his friend was chewing him out. He slowly came to understand that the woman’s</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:643.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">from his running days. Sometime in the early evening, after drinking what he would remember as only</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:660.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">a single beer, he felt oddly light and excused himself to step outside. Then time broke into</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:678.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">disconnected segments. He was in his car, driving, with no idea where he was or how he’d gotten</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:695.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">there. He wove through the streets, disoriented, and came into a hilly neighborhood of mansions and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:712.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">broad lawns. His head spun round and round. He stopped the car and rolled out. There was a tree in</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:729.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">front of him, and he relieved himself against it.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:36.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">building. Opening the door, he saw Cynthia, frantic with worry. He toppled into bed. When he woke</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:54.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">up and dressed, he had no memory of the night before, and couldn’t understand why the heels of his</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:88.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">called the police and reported it stolen. Two days later, the police called to tell him that they’d found</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:492.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Cynthia pleaded with Louie to stop drinking. It did no good.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:291.01px;top:525.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">——</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:557.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The further Louie fell, the less he could hide it. Ric Applewhite noticed that he was manically</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:574.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">germophobic, washing his hands over and over again, and each time, scouring the faucet and handles</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:591.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">on the sink. Some of Louie’s friends spoke to him about his drinking, but their words had no impact.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:626.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">about it. Pete, too, was worried about Louie, but knew only of his financial woes. He had no idea that</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:643.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie had slid into alcoholism, or that he had hatched a wild scheme to kill a man.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:660.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Cynthia was distraught over what her husband had become. In public, his behavior was frightening</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:678.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and embarrassing. In private, he was often prickly and harsh with her. She did her best to soothe him,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:695.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">to no avail. Once, while Louie was out, she painted their dreary kitchen with elaborate illustrations of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:712.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">vines and animals, hoping to surprise him. He didn’t notice.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:729.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Wounded and worried, Cynthia couldn’t bring Louie back. Her pain became anger, and she and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:747.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie had bitter fights. She slapped him and threw dishes at him; he grabbed her so forcefully that he</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:19.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie was so snide to her, right in front of their friends, that she walked off the boat. He chased her</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:36.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">down and grabbed her by the neck. She slapped his face, and he let her go. She fled to his parents’</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:71.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Cynthia eventually came back, and the two struggled on together. His money gone, Louie had to tap</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:88.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">a friend for a $1,000 loan, staking his Chevy convertible as collateral. The money ran out, another</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">investment foundered, the loan came due, and Louie had to turn over his keys.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:123.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">When Louie was a small child, he had tripped and fallen on a flight of stairs while hurrying to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:140.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">school. He had gotten up, only to stumble and fall a second time, then a third. He had risen convinced</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:157.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">that God himself was tripping him. Now the same thought dwelt in him. God, he believed, was toying</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:174.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">with him. When he heard preaching on the radio, he angrily turned it off. He forbade Cynthia from</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:192.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">going to church.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:209.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">In the spring of 1948, Cynthia told Louie that she was pregnant. Louie was excited, but the prospect</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:226.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">of more responsibility filled him with guilt and despair. In London that summer, Sweden’s Henry</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:278.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">beaten into dehumanized obedience to a world order in which the Bird was absolute sovereign, and it</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:295.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was under this world order that he still lived. The Bird had taken his dignity and left him feeling</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:187.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">throngs, and each sermon was a workout, delivered in a booming voice, punctuated with broad</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:204.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">gestures of the hands, arms, and body. He got up as early as five, and he stayed in the tent late into the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:222.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">night, counseling troubled souls.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:239.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Graham’s weight was dropping, and dark semicircles shadowed his eyes. At times he felt that if he</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:256.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">stopped moving, his legs would buckle, so he took to pacing his pulpit to keep himself from keeling</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:273.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">over. Once, someone brought a baby to him, and he asked whose child she was. He’d been away from</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:291.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">home for so long that he didn’t recognize his own daughter. He longed to end the campaign, but the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:308.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">success of it made him sure that Providence had other wishes.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:325.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">When Louie and Cynthia entered the tent, Louie refused to go farther forward than the back rows.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:342.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">He sat down, sullen. He would wait out this sermon, go home, and be done with it.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:360.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">The tent was hushed. From someplace outside came a high, beckoning sound. Louie had known that</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:377.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">sound since his boyhood, when he’d lain awake beside Pete, yearning to escape. It was the whistle of</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:394.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">a train.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:291.01px;top:426.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">——</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:459.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">When Graham appeared, Louie was surprised. He’d expected the sort of frothy, holy-rolling charlatan</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:476.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">that he’d seen preaching near Torrance when he was a boy. What he saw instead was a brisk, neatly</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:493.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">groomed man two years younger than himself. Though he was nursing a sore throat and asked that his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:510.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">amplifier be turned up to save his voice, Graham showed no other sign of his fatigue. He asked his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:528.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">listeners to open their Bibles to the eighth chapter of John.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:64.98px;top:560.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Jesus went unto the mount of Olives. And early in the morning he came again into the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:64.98px;top:577.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them. And the scribes</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:64.98px;top:594.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:64.98px;top:612.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">midst, They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act. Now</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:64.98px;top:629.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou? This</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:64.98px;top:646.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:64.98px;top:663.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not. So when they continued</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:64.98px;top:681.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:64.98px;top:698.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">him first cast a stone at her. And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground. And they</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:64.98px;top:715.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:64.98px;top:732.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:64.98px;top:750.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw no one but the woman, he said unto her, Woman,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:64.98px;top:767.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? She said, No man, Lord. And</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:36.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie was suddenly wide awake. Describing Jesus rising from his knees after a night of prayer,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:54.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Graham asked his listeners how long it had been since they’d prayed in earnest. Then he focused on</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:71.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Jesus bending down, his finger tracing words in the sand at the Pharisees’ feet, sending the men</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">“What did they see Jesus write?” Graham asked. Inside himself, Louie felt something twisting.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:123.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">“Darkness doesn’t hide the eyes of God,” Graham said. “God takes down your life from the time</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:140.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">you were born to the time you die. And when you stand before God on the great judgment day, you’re</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:297.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Even as he had this thought, he felt the lie in it. He knew what he had become. Somewhere under</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:315.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">his anger, there was a lurking, nameless uneasiness, the shudder of sharks rasping their backs along</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:332.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">the bottom of the raft. There was a thought he must not think, a memory he must not see. With the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:349.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">urgency of a bolting animal, he wanted to run.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:366.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Graham looked out over his audience. “Here tonight, there’s a drowning man, a drowning woman,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:384.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">a drowning man, a drowning boy, a drowning girl that is out lost in the sea of life.” He told of hell</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:401.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">and salvation, men saved and men lost, always coming back to the stooped figure drawing letters in</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:435.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">“Every head bowed and every eye closed,” said Graham, offering a traditional invitation to</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:453.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">repentance, a declaration of faith, and absolution. Louie grabbed Cynthia’s arm, stood up, and bulled</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:470.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">his way from the tent.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:487.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Somewhere in the city, a siren began a low wail. The sound, rising and falling slowly, carried</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:504.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">through the tent, picked up by the microphone that was recording the sermon.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:522.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">That night, Louie lay helpless as the belt whipped his head. The body that hunched over him was</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:603.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie rose from his nightmares to find Cynthia there. All morning Sunday, she tried to coax him into</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:621.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">seeing Graham again. Louie, angry and threatened, refused. For several hours, Cynthia and Louie</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:638.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">argued. Exhausted by her persistence, Louie finally agreed to go, with one caveat: When Graham</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:655.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">said, “Every head bowed, every eye closed,” they were leaving.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:672.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Under the tent that night, Graham spoke of how the world was in an age of war, an age defined by</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:690.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">persecution and suffering. Why, Graham asked, is God silent while good men suffer? He began his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:707.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">answer by asking his audience to consider the evening sky. “If you look into the heavens tonight, on</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:724.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">this beautiful California night, I see the stars and can see the footprints of God,” he said. “…  I think</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:39.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie was winding tight. He remembered the day when he and Phil, slowly dying on the raft, had</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:56.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">slid into the doldrums. Above, the sky had been a swirl of light; below, the stilled ocean had mirrored</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:90.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">forgetting that he was dying, Louie had known only gratitude. That day, he had believed that what lay</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:108.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">around them was the work of infinitely broad, benevolent hands, a gift of compassion. In the years</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:125.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">since, that thought had been lost.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:142.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Graham went on. He spoke of God reaching into the world through miracles and the intangible</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:159.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">blessings that give men the strength to out-last their sorrows. “God works miracles one after another,”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:177.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">he said. “…  God says, ‘If you suffer, I’ll give you the grace to go forward.’ ”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:194.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie found himself thinking of the moment at which he had woken in the sinking hull of </span><span class="cls_002">Green</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:228.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">remembered the Japanese bomber swooping over the rafts, riddling them with bullets, and yet not a</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:246.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">single bullet had struck him, Phil, or Mac. He had fallen into unbearably cruel worlds, and yet he had</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:263.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">borne them. When he turned these memories in his mind, the only explanation he could find was one</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:280.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">in which the impossible was possible.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:297.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">What God asks of men, said Graham, is faith. His invisibility is the truest test of that faith. To know</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:349.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">asked for heads to bow and eyes to close, Louie stood abruptly and rushed for the street, towing</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:366.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Cynthia behind him. “Nobody leaving,” said Graham. “You can leave while I’m preaching but not</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:418.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie pushed past the congregants in his row, charging for the exit. His mind was tumbling. He felt</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:435.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">enraged, violent, on the edge of explosion. He wanted to hit someone.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:453.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">As he reached the aisle, he stopped. Cynthia, the rows of bowed heads, the sawdust underfoot, the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:470.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">tent around him, all disappeared. A memory long beaten back, the memory from which he had run the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:487.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">evening before, was upon him.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:504.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie was on the raft. There was gentle Phil crumpled up before him, Mac’s breathing skeleton,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:539.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">sharks, waiting, circling. He was a body on a raft, dying of thirst. He felt words whisper from his</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:556.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">swollen lips. It was a promise thrown at heaven, a promise he had not kept, a promise he had allowed</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:285.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Louie had to be deputized by a sheriff to gain custody of him. He took the boys fishing, swimming,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:614.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">work, tending rice paddies. Then, one day in March 1952, as he read a newspaper, his eyes had</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:631.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">paused over a story. The arrest order for suspected war criminals had been lifted. There on the page</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:573.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">those serving life sentences, would soon be paroled. It appears that even Sueharu Kitamura, “the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:120.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">early 1980s, an American military officer visiting Japan heard something about the Bird being alive.</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:276.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">was motivated by the same vanity that had consumed him in wartime, and hoped to use his vile</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:396.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">He made a fist and waved it past his chin. “If the former prisoners want, I would offer to let them</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:517.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">shameful thing for them to have done. I knew nothing about the Geneva Convention. I asked my</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:534.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">commanding officer about it, and he said, ‘This is not Geneva, this is Japan.’</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:204.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">group dedicated to building a peace park to honor the dead POWs and bring reconciliation. Among</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:256.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">his Allied counterparts had endured in his own village, he was horrified. A council was formed,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:273.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">fund-raising began, and exhibits were erected in town. If the plan succeeded, Joetsu would become,</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:325.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Though 85 percent of Joetsu residents donated to the park fund, the plan generated heated</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:342.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">controversy. Some residents fought the plan vehemently, calling in death threats and vowing to tear</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:360.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">down the memorial and burn supporters’ homes. In keeping with the goal of reconciliation, the</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:71.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">profiling Louis Zamperini. Watanabe knew the name immediately. “Six hundred prisoner,” he said.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:88.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">“Zamperini number one.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:105.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Bob Simon, CBS’s on-air correspondent for the story, thought that this would probably be his only</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:123.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">chance to question Watanabe, so there in the lobby, he began grilling him about his treatment of Louie.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:140.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Watanabe was startled. He said something about Zamperini being a good man, and how he—</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:157.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Watanabe—hated war. He said that his central concern had been protecting the POWs, because if</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:174.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">they had escaped, civilians would have killed them. Asked why he’d been on the list of most wanted</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:192.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">war criminals, he puffed with apparent pride. “I’m number seven,” he said. “Tojo number one.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:209.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Exile, he said, had been very painful for him.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:226.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">They asked Watanabe if he’d come upstairs for an on-camera interview. Watanabe asked if the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:243.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">interview would air in Japan, and Mihailovich said no. To Mihailovich’s surprise, Watanabe agreed.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:261.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Upstairs, with cameras rolling, they handed Watanabe a photograph of a youthful Louie, standing</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:278.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">on a track, smiling. Simon dug in.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:295.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">“Zamperini and the other prisoners remember you, in particular, being the most brutal of all the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:312.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">guards. How do you explain that?”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:330.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Watanabe’s right eyelid began drooping. Mihailovich felt uneasy.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:347.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">“I wasn’t given military orders,” Watanabe said, contradicting the assertion he’d made in the 1995</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:381.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">Zamperini was well known to me. If he says he was beaten by Watanabe, then such a thing probably</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:416.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">He tossed his head high, jutted out his chin, and directed a hard gaze at Simon. He said that the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:433.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">POWs had complained of “trifle things” and had used epithets to refer to the Japanese. These things,</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:450.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">he said, had made him angry. With hundreds of prisoners, he said, he’d been under great pressure.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:468.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">“Beating and kicking in Caucasian society are considered cruel. Cruel behavior,” he said, speaking</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:485.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">very slowly. “However, there were some occasions in the prison camp in which beating and kicking</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:502.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">were unavoidable.”</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:519.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">When the interview was over, Watanabe looked shaken and angry. Told that Zamperini was</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:537.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">coming to Japan and wanted to meet him to offer his forgiveness, Watanabe replied that he would see</span></div>

<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:571.50px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">of the Japanese military.</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:19.99px;top:588.75px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">As they packed up, Mihailovich had a last request. Would he agree to be filmed walking down the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:606.00px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">street? This, it seemed, was what Watanabe had come for. He donned his cap, stepped to the</span></div>
<div style="position:absolute;left:5.00px;top:623.25px" class="cls_004"><span class="cls_004">sidewalk, turned, and walked toward the camera. He moved just as he had in parades before his</span></div>
